            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Author's Preface to the READER.</head>
                  <p>BE pleased (Courteous Reader) to take notice, That the design of these papers at the first was to attain some clearness in the practice of Baptism in Infancy and Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And to that end take in consideration of the whole History of Baptism: which, being an untrodden path, may be some Apology for the Abruptures of the stile, and method of proceeding.</p>
                  <p>That they should not be buried, or conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (notwithstanding the Authors weakness in expressing himself, and indisposition by reason of Age to make alterations in them) hath been the advice of several learned men under whose eyes they have passed.</p>
                  <p>That they come forth now without any commendatory names, though some were in a readiness, is the resolution of the Author up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on second thoughts, being perswaded, that the Nobleness of the Subject, attended with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of useful matter, tending to rectifie some mistakes, compose some differences, fix the power of a Christians profession, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his comforts, and all presented in a new method, will be inducement enough to a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person to read and peruse, and when he
<pb facs="tcp:50669:5"/> hath read, he is left to the freedom of his own judgment.</p>
                  <p>Only let the Reader be intreated not to do with this as some do with a <hi>Gazette:</hi> They read it, and lay it aside, and say there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, and so neither impart what they read, nor incourage others, when another of lesser intelligence finds variety of matter to discourse of. If thou beest of so great intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in divine things, that this cannot add to thy stature, yet give others leave to read, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and consider, who profess not so great perfection, and to whom all is little enough, either to satisfie their scruples, or to raise up their spirits to a due care, to get, and keep a good conscience: And slack not thy own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours (as becomes a lover of truth) to supply what is here wanting, to rectifie what is here mistaken, and to improve these Notions to a greater height for the benefit of the Church of God in unity and peace. For assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, the right conceptions about Baptism do tend thereto as much as any other point what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. That this may be the fruit of this and the labour of all those that seek the welfare of <hi>Zion</hi> in sincerity, is and shall be the prayer of the Author, who desires to be known by the name of</p>

                     <p>WHen a Christian sets himself to meditate on the noble Subject of the works of God, he may well sit down and say:<note place="margin">Psal. 40.5.9. Ps. 111.8.</note>
                        <hi>Many O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hact done: And thy thoughts to us ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order to thee; would I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbred:</hi> yet when he considers that the great works of God are to be sought out, and not only so, but preach'd to the great Congregation, and that it is a work of much profitable delight, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50669:6"/> delightful profit to the soul that is taken with the love of Christ, he rises up from his meer admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts, and betake himself to the Word of God to see what is revealed there, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Spirit of Christ, that what is revealed there, may be revealed to him, that so having right apprehensions of God and his ways, he may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of light vouchsased, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and honour him who is blessed for ever, Amen.</p>
                     <p>Isa. 28.29. <hi>He is wonderful in counsel, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in working.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His works are the product of his counsels. The excellency of his workings argues the excellency of his counsels. As we cannot conceive the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his working, so we cannot comprehend the greatness of his counsels. His counsels are wonderful, because they proceed from such an one as himself. His works are excellent because they center in himself.</p>
                     <p>Act. 15.18. <hi>Known to the Lord are all his works from the beginning of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God doth not do his work at a venture, but hath laid the whole plot aforehand, how every thing shall he, one thing in order to another, from the first day of the creation to the last day of the dissolution. So that every thing hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the divine Platform, before they have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themselves, and are known to God before they are, and foretold by Him before they come
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50669:6"/> to pass. And if any thing seem weak or imperfect in his work, as the fall of Angels, the sin of man, death and misery in the world, contrarieties and contradictions to that which is good: yet as it stands in the divine Platform Introductory to some others works, it is good and perfect and could not be better: The <hi>Chaos</hi> or confused <hi>Mass</hi> created the first day, was very good and perfect as it stood in order to the work of the other days.</p>
                     <p>Rom. 11.36. <hi>Of him and through him, and for him are all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As all things are laid out in the divine Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form how they shall be in their severall times: So there is an Influence of divine power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for the enlivening and production of every thing in its season.

                     <p>We may consider Gods order of working &amp; the order of his works. <hi>The order of his working</hi> is in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50669:7"/> order of the divine relations in his own nature, according to which he works and manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The Father works by the Son, the Son with the Father, the Father and the Son by the Spirit. The Fathers Kingdom is the utmost end of all the Fathers contrivances, that he may be all in all: He is absolutely the first and the last. The Kingdom of the Son is the great means to accomplish the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father, as the master-wheel that turns the lesser Wheeles to strike the hour the Hand points to. Hence all things are by Christ and for Christ, all things shut into his hand that he may effect the glory of the Fathers Kingdom, and when he hath done the work the Father gave him to do, he will resign the Kingdom to the Father: Hence the Son is the first and the last of all those means the Father hath designed to effect his Kingdom; and therefore our Saviour who sought the glory of him that sent him, taught us, to pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and desire that his name as the utmost end may be glorified, that his Kingdom; the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father may come as the way to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that his will may be done as the means to accomplish his Kingdom: Now this doing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will in order to his Kingdom is by Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As he himself says, lo I come to do thy will O God, by which doing of the Fathers will we are sanctified.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.9, 10.</note> And seeing this will of the Father was to be done on earth, as well as in Heaven, therefore he descended and ascended, and will come again to finish the work upon earth and in the Heavens. And this our Saviour teach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es us to desire, because the work of the Kingdom is the Fathers contrivance, <hi>Thine is the Kingdom</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50669:7"/> And the power of the means whereby this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is wrought out is by the Fathers appointment, namely by Christ, who is the wisdom of God and the power of God, by whom all his wills are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, <hi>Thine is the power,</hi> and because the <hi>Glory also</hi> is the Fathers. So that we are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Glory and Honour to be due to Christ for ever, but so as in subordination to his Fathers Glory.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The order of Gods works</hi> proceeds from that which is natural to that which is Spiritual: from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect to the more perfect, and to the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Gods design is to make all things new, spiritual and heavenly in earnest conformity to himself. He lays the foundation of the spiritual in the natural, because the spirituality of things is not in the abolishing their natures but refining them to be sit for more excellent use: Thus grace is the exalting, and refining mans nature. Water in Baptism is spiritual water. <hi>Mannah was spiritual Meat. The Body is raised a spiritual Body.</hi>

                     <p>The works of nature, were brought forth not all at once but in several days, the former making
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50669:8"/> way to the latter, the latter perfecting the former, all compleated in a perfect natural man, the head of the natural creation. And when all was done, is pleased the divine Majesty to rest from proceeding further in that work and to put it to the tryal, whether this natural man whithout a farther grace could stand against Satans tentations, that so he might have Glory by him in observing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: But the work was broken upon the wheel: It must be made new to accomplish his glorious ends. Nature will not do of it self, it must have a supply of strength from above, which how to effect now man had transgress'd and was fallen into the curse of God and bondage of Satan, did (or according to the manner of our conceiving) <hi>as it were</hi> put God on new counsels, how to bring all right again and make them new. After the seventh days rest (wherein tis very likely he put this work of nature on the trial as requiring some service from man and teaching him how to keep an holy rest in Communion with God), the Father and the Son, fall to work about a new Creation or a new way or Covenant to make all things spirituall, which must be done by the Son himself, descending in mans nature to make a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God to the nature of man, and lead his captivity captive, and make to the Father by his Intercession, That a new heart and a new spirit may be given to the sons of men, so to stablish him by the grace of God, that he might have his intended Glory by him. For this end a sure and Everlasting Covenant is made by the Father and the Son, for the carrying on this Work, and this Covenant must be made known to man in succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50669:8"/> ages: And man must be taught how to carry himself answerable to so great a mercy prepared in Christ, and offered and made known by Christ. Now the transacting of this with man is called a Covenant, the Covenant of Grace and the new Covenant; and those of mankind that are under this transaction or Treaty are called the Church of God, which is a means ordained by God to work man off from the interest of the old <hi>Adam</hi> to a self-denial, and casting off all confidence in the power of nature, and work him into Jesus Christ, in whom when he is throughly rooted, he is safe from Satans subtilties, fit to do his Creator ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and capable of entring again into the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of God: But the Original or Fundamental Covenant of Grace is that which is made between the Father and the Son as the second <hi>Adam, Gal.</hi> 3.19.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note>

                     <p>This seed of Christ is not only an invisible seed, known only to God, but a visible seed also, known and discerned to be his professed seed among men, for it is said <hi>He shall see his seed:</hi> And the reason seems plain, because it is the Fathers design to glorifie Christ here on earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.5.

For though this seed is not confined to, yet it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the natural generation of men, and is not discontinued but by their Apostatizing and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, which is never suddenly done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Covenant is of grace, and God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to glorifie his patience toward man: Nor is it done on small offences, but such as are properly Covenant breaking, and on much obstinacy and incorrigibleness, as in the old world, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Jewish nation.</p>
                     <p>That such <hi>a visible national seed</hi> is promised to Christ may be further evidenced by some prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical passages in the 22. <hi>Psalm.</hi>

                     <p n="10">10. By the first <hi>Adam</hi> sin abounded, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed in the world: And to discover the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous violence of the wayes thereof, God set bounds to it by the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that man might know what a fountain of evil there was in his heart, that rises so much the higher, by how much the banks are made the stronger: The strength of sin is discovered by the law: For sin (the Apostle saith) takes an occasion by the Commandment to work in us all manner of concupiscence.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7, 8, 9.</note> When the law comes to reprove sin, sin revives its opposition against the law.</p>

                     <p>Of all the works of God, the Church is the choicest and most curious piece; as that which he hath peculiarly set apart to be the object of his mercies, and the subject of his praises. The Church is among the other Creatures as the Sun, among the stars; every star hath its Influence, but all conveyed to the earth by the beams of the Sun. So all the Creatures are as it were beholden to the Church to be their mouth, &amp; their hand to God to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50669:14"/> offer up their praises, and pay their tribute by the gracious intercession of the Mediator, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled all things to God: That as all did flow from the Father by Christ, so all may return by Christ to the Father. Hence the Church of God is described by the Spirit of God to be <hi>A peculiar people whom God hath formed for himself.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This forming work is not a bringing his work to greatest perfection at the first, but it proceeds by degrees, and every degree is a forming, or making new (as appears by comparing <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and 19. and this 21.) New things do I declare, &amp;c. Now they are called new, and a reforming; not because the old frame is dissolved, but because he brings forth his Church upon a new Surveigh: As when a skilful watch-maker takes a view of some curious piece (which he hath long agon made) takes it asunder, scours and brightens the wheels, adds or alters where he sees he may better the work, and puts the frame together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Or as a Printer, by the Authors consent, takes a review of a book whose impression begins to wear out, corrects, adds, alters, or enlarges the first frame of the book continuing, and so puts it forth in a new Edition: So God new forms or reforms his Church, scouring away the rust and filth, that iniquity of times hath contracted, which cannot be sometimes without taking the work in pieces, and disjointing the body, only to the intent there may be a better coagmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and sometime adds more lustre and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his work, but never takes away the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of the first formation. Thus he refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at mount <hi>Sinai</hi> by additional laws: At their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50669:14"/> return out of captivity, by scouring off the filth of their idolatry, and giving a spirit of repentance, and experience of a new deliverance, matter of new praises of this new forming after their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. These places are to be meant in the first and literal sence, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.18. Remember not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things, behold I will do a new thing: This is explained by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> 23.7, 8. It shall be no more said, the Lord liveth that brought out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but which brought out of the land of the <hi>North.</hi> And to the same purpose it is promised, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. in reference to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that at their return out of <hi>Captivity</hi> it should be new. And God would put his law in their inward parts: And they should no more teach one another, saying, Know the Lord, for they shall all know me, &amp;c. All this is meant of their new forming in their return out of <hi>Captivity.</hi> Then their former deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was old and their deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> new. Then they did no more teach one another, saying, Know the Lord, who delivered our Fathers out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but know the Lord who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you all experimental knowledge of him in bringing you out of <hi>Babylon</hi> from the greatest to the least. The Scripture hath frequently put an absolute negative for a comparative. At that time also a new heart and a new spirit was given them, both in respect of repentance for former sins: And to sing forth new praises to God. Yet all these promises are called the new Covenant in the days of the Gospel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. Because after Christs ascending into Heaven there was another higher Reformation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. Wherein there
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50669:15"/> was a scouring of the rust, removing the rubbish, brightning the fundamentals, substituting some new observations, and an enlargment of members, and this is said over again, They shall no more say, know the Lord, namely, who brought you out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor know the Lord who delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but know the Lord who hath redeemed you from the curse of the Law, who hath led your <hi>Captivity Captive,</hi> and who is gone into Heaven to make peace, and intercedes for you, whereof all that believe in him have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience from the greatest to the least, by the peace they find in their Consciences, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a further Reformation of the Church, to be brought forth in the last, and best edition, when the new Heavens and new Earth, wherein Righteousness shall dwell, shall be brought forth; the Beast and false Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> a quiet habitation, and a praise in the earth; when there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying out for oppression, and persecution on account of the Gospel.<note place="margin">Rev. 21.3, 4, 5.</note> For he that sits on the throne hath said it in reference to the time to come in words of truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, behold I make all things New.</p>
                     <p>All this is the work of God alone, who plants the Heavens and lays the foundation of the earth,<note place="margin">Levit, 26.12. Jer. 31 33. 1 Pet. 2.10. Rev. 21.3.</note> says unto <hi>Zion,</hi> Thou art my people and I am the Lord thy God. Which last words (it is to be observed) are used at the several periods of times of Gods reformations both under the law and Gospel, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. To shew that the Covenant of Grace
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50669:15"/> is the same throughout all dispensations.</p>
                     <p>In this work man hath nothing to do to add, alter or enlarge, any other ways than Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self directs and goes before them, as may be seen in the charge of Christ to <hi>Moses</hi> and his Apostles. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25 40. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.<note place="margin">Exo. 7.40. De. 12.32. Mat. 28.20.</note> For it belongs only to him to direct how the Mistery of the Mediator is to be taught and signified, how the Covenant is to be transacted twixt God and his people, and what shall be pleasing and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to himself.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there is a work of Reformation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man is much interested, and which God doth almost continually call us unto, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.23. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.16, 17.<note place="margin">Lev. 26.23. Is. 1.16, 17.</note> Which is to <hi>repent for</hi> our many Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from his Covenant, and <hi>reduce our selves to obedience</hi> according to the administration we are under, and so to labour to understand what is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of the Lord and do it. But whilst man is so busie in medling with Gods interest, and so negligent about his own, it provokes God to take the work into his own hand, but to the no small detriment of those that set themselves to walk contrary to God, in a work so highly touching his honour, and the good of his people.</p>
                     <p>1 Pet. 3.20, 21. <hi>The long suffering of God waited in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by water,</hi>

                        <hi>the like figure whereunto, or Antitype, Baptism now saves us also by the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jesus Christ, not the puttting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience unto God.</hi>

                     <p>1 Cor. 10.2, 3, 4, 6. <hi>Our fathers were all Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised unto</hi> Moses <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink. Now these things were our Types or exemplars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the divine wisdom hath framed the pattern, and model of all things in his own holy mind, wherein he foresees all things before they are, and according to which, he produces all things in their seasons: So he is pleased to order his work in such manner, that one work preceding shall be the type, copy, or pattern of another that is to follow, as the antitype of it, until the whole work be compleat, as it was first intended in himself. There is the prototype type, and architype. As a painter takes the lively Image of the person himself for his first type and copy, and draws out the lines and proportion of the feature with dark colours on a table for his first draught: and after a certain space draws out another picture every way answerable to the first, but more compleat and lively, filling up many vacancies, setting it out with more orient colours to the perfect resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Image of the person himself, and so far beyond the first draught that it seems a new piece, when indeed the last draught hath the same lines and proportions as the first, only it is set forth with more splendid, and permanent colours. Here the Image of the person himself is the prototype, the first draught the type, the second draught the antitype, as being answerable to the first; as also coming nearer than the first to the prototype. Thus it being the office of our Lord Jesus Christ enjoyned by the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50669:16"/> Father to form up a Church and house of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern and image in the mind of the Father, communicated to him, the Son, and great prophet, in whom are stored up the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; he makes a first draught of it under the old Testament, drawing out the fundamental lines from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah;</hi> adding some colours from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> by whose pencil the first draught was polished, with many watry colours exactly according to the first pattern given him by Christ. But in the new Testament he brings forth the antitype answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the typical draught, and the prototype in the mind of God. So that although there are the same lineaments and proportions of the Church in the new Testament, as in the old, yet the spiritual Glory doth so far exceed the Glory of the old, that it seems as wholy new. As when a man hath the lively picture of his friend to refresh him in his absence, at last he comes to himself, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of whom the picture is laid aside.</p>
                     <p>And here it is to be observed that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks of two sorts of types. The one in comparing the Covenant of nature with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; the first <hi>Adam</hi> who was the head of the one, with the second <hi>Adam</hi> who was the head of the other. The first <hi>Adam</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">

By the first man came sin and death, by the second Righteousness and life. As a plaister fits the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50669:17"/> sore, and a medicine the disease, by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualities.</p>
                     <p>The other, in comparing the dispensation of the Covenant of grace under the old Testament, with the dispensation of the same under the new, and so a type signifies a <hi>likeness by way of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

For the word Antitype may be spoken either of the type or thing typified, because the thing typified doth chiefly agree with the prototype or first pattern, and the type is the antytipe of the first pattern, that is, an answerable Representation: But as type signifies propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, pointing at some thing to come, so the thing to come is properly the antitype.</p>

But when
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50669:21"/> there is a renewing of Church-hood after a breach of Covenant either among Jews or Gentiles, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is the standing Type or pattern of it.</p>
                     <p>For the promise of Church-hood, as of a visible Kingdom for God in the World is first made to Christ,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.10.</note>

It pleased God to make choice of that seed, before Christs coming in the flesh, that were the Kindred of Christ according to the flesh, and to six his Church in that seed especially who were of his natural line. But after his Ascending into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he did visibly adopt the seed of all Beleiving Gentiles, to be his feed in their generations keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant. Now for the better understanding this seed, God is pleased to set up <hi>Abraham</hi> as a type of it, declaring he had made him a Father of many nations: That in him all nations of the earth should be blessed, and he would be his God and the God of his seed, natural or adopted, in their generations keeping Covenant.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The difference between the Covenant of nature,</hi> (which was a Covenant of Justice) and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, was typified when <hi>Moses</hi> brake the two tables, when he came down from the mount, upon the sight of the calf or Idol, which they made, signifying they had broke the Covenant, and were naked to the curse as <hi>Adam</hi> was at the first transgression; and therefore could not stand before God, on the account of the first Covenant. Then God is pleased to command two new Tables to be hewed, in which he wrote the law again, and proclaimed his name of mercy and forgiveness and of Justice on contempt of mercy in the second place,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.10.</note> and then renews his promises <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>v.</hi> 10. which did lively set forth the tenor of the new Covenant. For the first Covenant under which all are by nature, and which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to perform by the power of nature, admit no repentance nor remission. But they that lay
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50669:22"/> hold on the name of Gods free mercy (for he hath mercy on whom he will, and his good pleasure is the ground of this Covenant <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive pardon upon repentance,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.19.</note> and are under the promise of writing the law again in the Table of their hearts, by the finger of Gods spirit never to be broken or blotted out,<note place="margin">Jer. 32.31.</note> as is fully declared <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Covenant of grace being always the same for substance,</hi> yet hath a <hi>different dispensation</hi> and Ministration, cald the old and new Testament. How this difference stands, was typified by <hi>Moses</hi> his face shining, and his face vailed. The shining of his face shewed the transforming virtue, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the glorious mystery of Christ hath upon the soul of man, beholding it with a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and reverently admiring eye: For after God had shined into the hearts of the Apostles,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6</note> the light of the knowledg of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, they were so transformed into the same image;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> that were was a progress from Glory to Glory: From Glory in themselves to Glory in them that heard them, &amp; believed; which believers were transformed also into the image of Christ; even as the Moon is not only enlightned her self by the Suns looking on her, but is enabled thereby to reflect the light she recieves to the enlightning the dark world, and so is enlightned from light to light. This is the new Testament glory to discover Christ with open face, being row risen, and ascended into Heaven, and all the articles of our faith compleated, the discovery whereof begets the love of God and Christ in us, and love one to another, softens and melts the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50669:22"/> heart into Godly sorrow, works in us a denial of all confidence in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and breads a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Sons. But until Christ was ascended the transforming glory of Christ was covered with a vail of the strict observance of <hi>Moses</hi>'s law:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.13, 14.</note> and this vail was upon the heart of most of them, so that they could not see through it, for want of faith; but rested in the observation of the letter of the law,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.31 32.</note> as that whereby they expected justification and so mist the mark. But the new Testament even in the visible face of it is and unvailed Ministery, and a spiritually transforming Ministery: There is indeed a vail upon all Nations,<note place="margin">Isa. 25.7.</note> not which God cast upon the Ministery, but which Satan cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens eyes, who is the God of this world. The Jews are under a vail of obstinate cleaving to the law of <hi>Moses</hi> in opposition to Christ at this day: many of the Christian Gentiles put a vail of their own superstitions on the face of the Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and pretending to let the Sun in,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.15, 16.</note> they stand in the light with their own shadow. But let the Gospel shine in its own cleerness, and let men intentively beheld it, it will soon appear it is a transforming Ministery. And therefore the Holy Ghost speaking of the different dispensation of the law and the Gospel, saith they shall no more say one to another, Know the Lord, that is, according as they that were under the law said, Know the Lord, namely teaching to know the <hi>Messias</hi> in a promise a far of and by certain pictures and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations; but they shall all know me &amp;c. That is, all that intentively look after me, shall see me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the preaching of the Gospel, and the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by my glory: Which the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,

Believers are the living stones squared and carved of this temple, the embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred work of this tabernacle, in and among whom is the holy ointment of Christs precious graces and promises poured out, and the sweet perfume of holy thoughts, savoury speeches and useful works to the mutual content of the Bridegroom and the Bride.</p>

                     <p>Baptism is an ordinance of God of so great use in all ages of the Church, and in all the course of a Christian, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> thought fit to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it as the ground of his subsequent exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to sufferings and holiness. Both in this and the next Epistle 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 9. he expresses himself in few words but very significant, containing their principle assertions touching Baptism obvious to our observation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The nature and use of Baptism. It is a saving us by water. It is a saving ordinance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Oneness and Identity of Baptism. It is a salvation by water in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, and now; namely, since Christs ascending into Heaven Ours is the Antitype of <hi>Noahs</hi> and so the same in

                     <p>The cause of our salvation on Christs part is his death and Resurrection, whereby he hath made an Atonement with God in our nature, and hath given us an example how to walk to please God, and obtained the Spirit for them that Believe.</p>
                     <p>The Condition required on our part, is 1. That we Believe on him who died and rose again. 2. To be willing to be like or conformed to his pattern in his death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Now water and washing in Baptism by virtue of divine Institution, hath relation to these causes and conditions of our salvation; and doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie on the part of the Baptised that he imbraces the faith of Christ dying and rising again; and that he is willing to be like to Christ.</p>
                     <p>And on Gods part. That if this profession be sincere and the conscience do answer as in Gods sight the truth of this profession; then this water and washing doth signifie and assure Remission of sin: in which respect Baptism is said to save.</p>

                     <p>THe Family of <hi>Adam</hi> after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was made, was the first visible Church in the World, in which there was no distinction twixt the Church and the World, but all the World was the Church.</p>
                     <p>The World came to be distinct from the Church by an Act of Gods Excommunication for the sins of degenerate Church-Members; who not repenting, and returning again to their Fathers house were not accounted of the Church, nor their posterity, till they did repent, as those that were faithful kept the Church-priviledges for themselves and their posterity till they did apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50669:26"/>
                     <p>Hence the Scripture speaks in the singular number to such as were heads of the Apostacy, or heads of the faithful, in a collective sense, as looking at their posterity in them, pertaining to them and members of them. As in <hi>Cain, Cham, Esau,</hi> their posterity excommunicate and cursed in them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.11, 16.9.25, 26. In <hi>Noah, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Jacob,</hi> their posterity blessed in them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.9.17.9 <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Lu.</hi> 19.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. with <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15. And so it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule of Church-hood from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>It hath also been Gods way after a long time of patience, with his visible Church and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating notwithstanding into the manners of the Apostate-Churchlings, to begin his Church anew, and to choose them again, by separating them from the degenerate Churchlings by some providential Act of punishment on the one, and mercy on the other. Thus he brought the Flood, on the ungodly, saved <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, chose <hi>Abraham,</hi> and set a mark of Church-hood on his family, purged away the rebels by the captivity, and chose <hi>Jerusalem</hi> again, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 20.38. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.17. And by the Ministry of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> Christ and his Apostles gathered his Church into a new Society, and then rejects the obstinate Jews into darkness, that is without the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.10, 11.</p>
                     <p>There are <hi>three remarkable Periods,</hi> wherein he hath thus <hi>chose his Church</hi> into different Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations. The days of <hi>Noah.</hi> The days of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the days of <hi>Christ;</hi> wherein the Lord

                           <p>Their making the Ark, and entring into it at Gods command, testified their faith and obedience: <hi>Faith,</hi> in believing the truth of Gods Word, foretelling the Flood, and promising them safety, and in betaking themselves to the <hi>Messias,</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ark and refuge for poor sinners, who deny themselves.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note>

                           <p>The sacrifice which they offered of clean beasts and fowls was an open profession of their faith in the promised seed, who was to be slain to confirm the new Covenant, and that they continued in the Religion and Worship which their godly Fore-fathers had received from <hi>Adam,</hi> the head of the faithful in the old world.</p>

                              <hi>4.</hi> Here was a teaching after Baptism, in two things.</head>
                           <p>
                              <hi>First,</hi> God renews his laws, restores and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the liberties and priviledges of mankind, and teaches them, and the world in them; how they shall keep their Baptismal engagement, and be preserved from the Apostacy of the old world: which laws and liberties, <hi>Noah</hi> who was a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Righteousness, a Prophet and the chief Magistrate, and the first born in every family, who were the Priests and Rulers in that juncture
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50669:29"/> of time were to teach, and see kept in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generations.</p>
                           <p>They were summarily these.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The law of divine and instituted worship, That man is to come to God in the virtue of a sacrifice, or the blood of the Mediator, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20, 21.<note place="margin">Gen. 8.20.21.</note>
                              <hi>Noah</hi> built an altar to the Lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar, and the Lord smelled a sweet Savour. <hi>Noahs</hi> example was a sufficient pattern and Gods acceptance a sufficient Intimation of a command. And 'tis probable that the seventh day was used as the day of sacrifice: because <hi>Noah</hi> entred into the Ark the seventh day after the last warning <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.4, 13. The clean beast were taken in the Ark by sevens <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.2. The Ark rested the seventh month, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Noah</hi> stayed seven days and sent out the dove and then stayed other 7 days, and sent her out again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.10, 12. And the seven and twentieth day of the 2d. Month the Earth was dried, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.14. And probably the 28. day might be the day of rest and sacrifice. It adds to the probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the Gentiles, as they had always an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct about Sacrificing, so they had about the seventh day: But most of all, because God appoints in the fourth command of the Decalogue the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to rest on the sabbath; which is an Argument it was one of the precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> and not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Jews.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The liberty and law of Marriage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.1.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.1</note> God blessed <hi>Noah</hi> and his sons and said, Be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50669:30"/> and multiply and replenish the earth. By which Blessing is implied,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.2.</note> that by marriage the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church should be preserved and propagated: Domestical, and Political societies established, and inordinate lusts avoided.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The liberty and law of dominion over the Creatures <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.2.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.2.</note> The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every foule of the Air, upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea: Into your hand they are delivered. This law establisheth variety of outward callings and imployments for the good of mankind, setleth to every man a propriety in what he or his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors have acquired by a lawful title, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all cruely and inordinancy in the use of the Creature.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The liberty and law of the Food of mankind <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.3.4.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.3, 4.</note> Every moving thing that liveth, shall be meat for you, but flesh with the life thereof, the blood thereof, ye shall not eat. This law is a gracious concession to mankind to feed upon flesh as well as fruits and herbes, which it is probable was not enjoyed before the flood, but by a kind of usurpation eating the flesh in the warm blood, which exercised a cruelty towards the Creature, and tended to dispose the body and spirits to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane passions. Therefore God forbids to eat flesh with the life-blood, that is, whilst the life-blood is in the veines and not let out; but reserves the life-blood to be offered to him in sacrifice till the coming of the <hi>Messias Levit.</hi> 17.11, 12, 13, 14. And after his coming the Apostles advise the continuance of it among the Gentiles after sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50669:30"/> ceased, at least to avoyd offence to the Jews, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.29.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The law for preserving the life of man and punishing murder: <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.6.</note> Whosoever shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</p>
                           <p>These laws were by the ancient Jews called the seven precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> and are set down by M. <hi>Mede</hi> out of <hi>Maimonides</hi> and others under these titles. First the precept,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Mede Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribe</hi> on. Act. 17.4. &amp; Act. 11.4.</note> to renounce Idols and all idolatrous worship. Secondly to worship the true God and Creator of Heaven and Earth. Thirdly Blood-shed, to wit, to commit no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Fourthly, <hi>Detectio Nuditatum,</hi> not to be defiled with Fornication, Incest, or any unlawful Conjunction. Fifthly, Rapine, against Theft and Robbery. Sixthly, concerning Administration of Justice. The seventh, <hi>Membrum de vivo;</hi> so they call the precept of not eating the flesh with the blood. And <hi>Maimonides</hi> adds, <hi>Quicunque haec septem praecepta exequenda susceperit; Ecce is est ex piis gentium mundi, habet que partemin saeculo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo.</hi> Whosoever of the nations of the world shall take upon him the observance of these Seven Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, he is a godly man, and hath a share in the world to come.</p>
                           <p>These laws under these five or seven heads were those, the transgression of which brought on the Flood. The Law of Divine Worship by a Mediator seems first to be violated by <hi>Cain,</hi> who observed not <hi>Adams</hi> instruction to him as <hi>Abel</hi> did, which was as we may presume, first to come
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50669:31"/> to God by an expiatory sacrifice, confessing sin and guilt, and going to a Mediator to make peace, before he must expect God will accept his gifts: But he humbles not himself, comes in his own righteousness, and so offers his gifts. This was the rise of all idolatry and will-worship, either worshipping God without a Mediator, or by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or one of our won setting up. Promiscuous marriages, prodigious lusts, Rapine and violence against the lives and estates of men, practised by the Giants in stature and wicked manners, who were hunters of men as well as of beasts, whom they fed upon, tearing them asunder whilst yet alive, and eating them in their warm blood, the more to feed their lust and exasperate their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. These were the sins, which growing from a stream to a River, and from a River to an Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, overflowed all banks and bounds, even of the godly families themselves, and provoked God to send a Flood of vengeance, but saved eight persons only, whom he Baptised a new into the old Faith and Laws of obedience given to <hi>Adam</hi> in the first place.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> After this Baptism, God teaches them, and the world in them by a visible sign, <hi>the Bow in the Cloud.</hi> This was a sign <hi>de praeterito,</hi> and <hi>de futuro.</hi> In respect of what was past, it was a sign of Remembrance and Admonition, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the world was once drowned for the wickedness of the Inhabitants, that God hath his Bow bent and ready to take vengeance of Sinners that follow their example, and hath fire as well as water to execute that vengeance. But for the future it was a Teaching and an assuring sign that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50669:31"/> God would consider man,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.2.</note> and give him a day of grace, use much patience toward him in that day, and not always pour out all his wrath, though man deserve it to the end that such as were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen in Christ from all eternity might be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him in their times and generations: For it is a Bow without an arrow, not pointing to the earth but from the earth, and yet hath fiery co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in it, to signifie when the patience of God is fulfilled, the earth with the works therein shall be burnt up with fire. This is a standing visible sign to the whole world belonging to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace and continues when many of <hi>Moses</hi>'s ceremonies are discontinued. And in asmuch as Christ represents himself with a Rainebow about the Throne:<note place="margin">Rev. 4.3.10.1. Isa. 54.9. 2 Pet. 3.9, 7. 1 Thes. 4.17.</note> it should put us in mind to make a more frequent use of this sign, when we see it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Majesty of Christ now in glory, his patience now in a day of grace, his faithfulness in his promises, especially in coming again, to Judg the world by fire, and to be a new Ark to save his people from everlasting burnings.</p>
                           <p>These are the Morals, Ceremonials and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als belonging to <hi>Noahs</hi> Baptism.</p>
                        </div>
                     </div>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>Of being Baptised unto <hi>Moses.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>Now after God had drowned the ungodly by a flood, and by the same flood washt and renewed <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, and all future generations in them to a reformed estate with Renovation of laws, priviledges and promises, he did justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that man should be taken from his own
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50669:32"/> Imaginations, which were so evill before the flood, and that this Judgment on the old world and his merciful preservation and chusing them for a new world, and a new Church and their solemn engagement by this Baptismal Covenant should never be forgotten. But it was soon disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that there were many Hypocrites, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers in this Church who followed not the faith of their Father <hi>Noah,</hi> but became vain in their Imaginations, and their foolish hearts were full of darkness. <hi>Cham</hi> discovers himself to be a mocker and is cursed. And when they grew nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, Gods visible Election and Rejections doth manifest it self, as proceding by three degrees, wherein it was completed.</p>
                        <div n="1" type="section">
                           <head>The first degree was at the Confusion of Tongues.</head>
                           <p>Whilst they all spake one language they were all one Church. Their division of tongues was a Judgment of God dividing and separating them from the true Church, which continued in the faith of <hi>Noah,</hi> and were not divided from his language. The house of <hi>Sem</hi> who was the Father of all the Children of <hi>Heber. Gen.</hi> 10.21. who was the Father of all the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> of whom the <hi>Messias</hi> was to come in a direct line, was the house of the Church, which was now characterised by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> language in distinction from other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as it was by Circumcision afterwards: For when the Gentiles were by different languages divided from the house of <hi>Sem,</hi> and one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; it was a just Judgment of God for the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50669:32"/> schism they made from the house of <hi>Sem,</hi> who were not guilty of the transgression at <hi>Babel,</hi> but gave advice to the contrary, as those who clave to the faith and fear of <hi>Noah,</hi> as their keeping of <hi>Noahs</hi> language doth evidence. But there was an unbelieving and rebellious party, who not believing Gods promise to drown the world no more, though confirmed by a sign frequently obvious, nor obeying the command of God, to disperse and fill the earth whilst they yet spake one language, and so might communicate together as one Church, would notwithstanding follow their own foolish project, to keep together, and build a city and tower, that they might be free from fear of evill that might be by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flood contrary to the advice of <hi>Sem</hi> and his house,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.9.</note> who kept there station and waited upon God, how to be directed in dispersing themselves. For this cause they are excommunicated as <hi>Kain</hi> and his seed were. And this Bar of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the true Church not taken away till Christ of the seed of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had made peace by the blood of his Cross, and obtained from the right hand of the Father, That prophecy, and the gift of tongues should be Communicated to all Nations.<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note>
                           </p>

                           <head>The second degree of this Election and Rejection was at the Covenant renewed with Abraham.</head>
                           <p>For in this period twixt <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> the Church continued for ten generations and God raised up Prophets and Rulers to help them keep the truth, as it was revealed to <hi>Noah,</hi> as <hi>Noah</hi>
                              <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50669:33"/> himself in the first place, who lived 340 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flood; and <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> (if he were not <hi>Sem</hi> himself) who was a King and a Priest. A King to see Justice done according to the precepts of <hi>Noah.</hi> A Priest to teach them the way and meaning of the Sacrifices.</p>
                           <p>Yet the Lord seeing the other Nations depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further and further from him, and so far from returning to the children of <hi>Heber,</hi> that they grew rather in hatred of them. And perceiving a great inclination in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themselvs to false worship, either to have false gods or false media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (for <hi>Abrahams</hi> father had Idols) To preserve his Church from Apostacy, it pleased him to make a visible and solemn renewing of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to fix the visible Church-hood in him, &amp; his seed by <hi>Isaac,</hi> the better to keep them to the true Mediator of whom <hi>Isaac</hi> was a Type.</p>
                           <p>Now <hi>Abraham</hi> is another representative head to conveigh the interest to promises,<note place="margin">Is. 41.2. Gen. 12.1.</note> and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obedience to the succeeding Church. He is called to Gods foot. His Faith is proved se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.5.</note> and his faithfulness approved: He and his seed adopted by a letter of Gods own name added to his in a solemn manner: He stands before God,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.9.</note> as the Father of the faithful both of his own natural seed and of his adopted seed of all Nations. God says to him, Thou shalt keep my covenant, &amp;c. That is, Thou, thy son and thy daughter, &amp;c. in all generations, <hi>viz.</hi> The covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative Fathers before thee, and all other Laws which I shall further give to thee, and them in future generations, as a peculiar people.</p>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50669:33"/>
                           <p>This put the other Nations, a degree further from the true Church: for God set a mark in the flesh of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed, whereby they were peculiarly dedicated to God by the blood of the Covenant, and separated from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in point of Communion in Divine Worship. (For the Gentiles though they used sacrifices yet the worshipped they knew not what)<note place="margin">Joh. 4.21.</note> yet in civil commerce, they had communion with them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the precepts of <hi>Noah.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In this period from <hi>Nooh</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> we may see, That all the world was once again the visible Church; That God rejected the Nations for a Schism made from the true Church, where the way of true worship was fixed, and Divine Oracles revealed, which sin he punisht, by dividing them among themselves, taking away his good Spirit from them, leaving them to themselves, and setting up a partition-wall twixt them and his peculiar people. We may see also that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their rejection as a testimony of his great severity: yet he knows how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Church in the seed of the faithful as an Argument of his free grace and abundant mercy; and to carry on the covenant of grace under different dispensations, for this dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> was a preparation to the compleating that Church by a peculiar Church-discipline under <hi>Moses.</hi>

                           <p>When the time came, that God would form the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> grown very numerous, into a visible Kingdom, a well ordered Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and a Church-estate suitable thereunto: he raised up <hi>Moses</hi> and associated <hi>Aaron</hi> with him, to bring his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to lead them to mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> there to receive his Laws for the well ordering of Church and State, and be directed how the transaction of the covenant twixt him and his people, was to be carried on until the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed seed himself came, and the Gentiles visited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with his grace.</p>
                           <p>Before they came to <hi>Sinai,</hi> the more to engage them to the Lord to hearken to his voice by his servant <hi>Moses:</hi> he Baptises them all young and old unto <hi>Moses,</hi> in the Cloud and in the Sea. This Baptism in the Red sea was preparatory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory to the formal Covenant made at <hi>Sinai;</hi> and was like the Baptism of <hi>Noah</hi> in all the solemn circumstances of it.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Here is a teaching before Baptism</hi> in special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to belief of the present truth, whereof there is a profession before this general Baptism. The Gospel preached to them, and the present truth by them to be believed,<note place="margin">Exo. 4.31.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50669:34"/> Scripture gives this testimony of them all (though it was only actually true of such as had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) They believed the Lord and his servant <hi>Moses.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Here is Gods Call and Command</hi> to enter into the waters; Speak to the children of <hi>Israel</hi> that they go forward: like as to <hi>Noah,</hi>

                           <p>The Persons Baptised were as in the Ark. The believing and their seed that were in being, and their generations having a being virtually in them. Indeed those that were in the Ark were but few, but virtually the whole world: Those that past through the Sea, a great multitude, and yet representatively one only family of the whole earth; because since the Baptism of <hi>Noah,</hi> God had in Justice cast out the Nations, and in great mercy chose the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to carry on the interest of his visible Covenant, who multiplied as the stars of Heaven; and as they were once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in one person, so now the future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are represented in the present families, and dedicated to God by this solemn Baptism.</p>
                           <p>The Baptiser was not <hi>Moses,</hi> who was Baptised himself unto the Office he was called, and the people were baptised unto <hi>Moses,</hi> not by <hi>Moses,</hi> but God himself, or the Son of God, who said to <hi>Noah,</hi> Go into the Ark, and to <hi>Moses,</hi> Go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the Sea. He who is the greatest of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who knows the Fathers secrets, and spake to <hi>Moses</hi> face to face, being the image of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible God, called the Similitude of <hi>Jehovah:</hi>

                           <p>The cloud in which the Lord descended, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the admirable constitution of the person of the Mediator, being a cloud on one side in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his humane nature, and light or fire on the other, in respect of his Divine. No man hath seen God at any time, but through the cloud of our nature as through a vail.<note place="margin">Joh. 14.8, 9. Col. 9.15</note> The beams of his glory are so refracted, that God in Christ is made visible and intelligible, because Christ is the image of the invisible. In the cloud of this humane nature he descends to his people.</p>
                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50669:35"/>
                           <p>Moreover, The Pillar represented the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which Christ accomplished the work of our Redemption: First to pass through the Cloud of death, before he entred into his glory. As also the way of his Ministrations to his people: He came first by the cloudy Ministration of the Law, and then by the lightsome Ministrations of the Gospel; and therein first by Baptism with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then by Baptism with fire.</p>
                           <p>The watery cloud descending on them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove taught the people, Thy must be wash'd from the filth they contracted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which they must not expect to be wash'd from but by the Spirit of Christ poured on them from on high, and so become spiritual, that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Laws to be given them on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> For the natural man understands not the things of God, which are spiritual, and only discerned with a spiritual mind.</p>
                           <p>Their descending into the depths of the Sea, taught them to remember the desperate misery they were in, whilst they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where their condition was still worse and worse, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and deeper, until God of his meer mercy sent <hi>Moses</hi> to raise them up, and bring them out, and suffered not those waves to drown them. And so taught them the great misery on all mankind by <hi>Adams</hi> transgressing the first Covenant, until God sent his Son to be a second <hi>Adam</hi> to lead our <hi>Captivity</hi> captive, and bring us out of Satans bondage by his own sufferings, going down to the grave and rising again: And therefore that it is meet we should be conformable to him in his Death and Resurrection,<note place="margin">Col. 1.12.</note> and be willing that the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50669:36"/> old man with his lusts should be buried in us, that so we may be new men through Christ.</p>
                           <p>The waters of the Sea, through which they past and were saved, but the <hi>Egyptians</hi> attempting to pass through were drowned, taught them, That the Ordinances of God which are the way of life to them that believe, are the way of death to unbelievers and disobedient. The Word is the savour of death to them. They attempt them to their own ruine. They eat and drink their own damnation. So far from washing and cleansing, that it drowns them. Man fallen is so presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to venture at the tree of Life, though he have transgrest at the Tree of Knowledge; but God thrust him out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and set a guard about the Tree of Life, to warn him not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his peril, unless he come in the way of the new Covenant.</p>
                           <p>The redness of the Sea through which they past, might signifie, That as Christ came by water and blood, so the Church must expect to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in water and blood before they come to the land of rest.</p>
                           <p>God did not only teach them by these signs, but also engage himself, That if they would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Moses,</hi> become his Disciples and obey him, who was sent by Christ, the great Prophet, to give them Laws, and rule them in his stead: Then the Lord Jesus, the Angel of his presence, the Son of God, who appeared to them in the fiery and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pillar, as he did to <hi>Moses</hi> in the Bush, would be present with them, not only to save them from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage (the misery of the first <hi>Adam</hi>) but also assist them in all their conflicts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50669:36"/> with the <hi>Amorites</hi> (the tentations and afflictions) in the way to <hi>Canaan</hi> (the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) and bring them safe thither to enjoy (a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) Rest, (by Resurrection out of the deep of the grave). And in the mean while, That he will sprinkle clean water of his Spirit upon them,<note place="margin">Deu. 18, 15. Isa. 59.20. Isa. 44.3.4. Psa 74.9. Is. 6.9.10.</note> so that there shall not be wanting a succession of Prophets in <hi>Moses</hi> his stead, until the <hi>Messias</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self come. Nor a blessing upon their teachings. For this is a sign of Christs withdrawings, when he takes away vision; or the blessing of it, <hi>Ps.</hi> 74.8. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
                           <p>This engagement on Gods part was signified and confirmed by the miraculous dividing the waters, leading them through the deeps, sprinkling them with the misty Cloud; and when they were out of the sea, shading them with the dark side of the Cloud by day, and lighting them with the bright side of the Cloud by night, closing up the sea after they were gone out, whereby they saw with their eyes their enemies destroyed, and a bar put to stop up their way from returning into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that so they might now look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as a people wholy seperate from old <hi>Adams</hi> Interest, and not only set a part for God, but also actually embraced into his everlasting arms, to bear and carry them as his Sons and peculiar Inheritance, above all nations of the earth; for ever all the glory shall be a defence, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>On the peoples part:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.12.</note> Here was a solemn profession of their faith in the present truth (which Baptism always looks to) That God had sent his servant <hi>Moses</hi> to be a Deliverer, and Lawgiver to them. As also a profession of their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50669:37"/> obedience in that they readily followed <hi>Moses</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depths of the sea, and sang a song of praise with him, when they came on dry land.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Here is a Teaching after Baptism</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the ends of Baptism.<note place="margin">Is. 48.1.</note> God gives them laws at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the preface whereof refers to this Baptismal Covenant, I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the house of Bondage: Laws, in which they were to educate their Children from their infancy to be observed in all the generations of <hi>Jacob,</hi> till the coming of the <hi>Messias;</hi> and to be altred or abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him alone.</p>
                           <p>As it was in the teaching after <hi>Noahs</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, so here the laws are,
<list>
                                 <item>Moral, Containing the general grounds and principles of Godliness and Righteousness which are of perpetual equity.</item>
                                 <item>Ceremonial, Which are particular determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the will of God referring to divine worship.</item>
                                 <item>Judicials. Which are orders, and penalty for the better observing the other laws.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>Because <hi>Moses</hi> was a Mediator in giving and receiving these laws, they are therefore called a Covenant, an agreement being made twixt God and the people, by the intervention of <hi>Moses,</hi> solemnly transacted, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. Therefore the Apostle says;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.20.</note> a Mediator is not of One, but God is one, signifying, that such a Covenant argues two
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50669:37"/> parties in it, God and the people. The people stand before the Lord as a professedly believing people, believing the truth of the present word, and work of their redemption. But says he, God is one: His way of eternal salvation is but one, he abides one and the same for saving his people by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with the <hi>Messiah</hi> on the behalf of them, that believe and confess they cannot be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their own legal righteousness. So that this Covenant made at <hi>Sinai,</hi> was not intended to be cross or contradictory to the standing Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, but only subservient, and tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the observing of a peculiar Discipline, by a peculiar people, until the <hi>Messias</hi> should come.</p>
                           <p>This Mosaical, or Disciplining Covenant,<note place="margin">Ex. 19.5, 6 Heb. 9.13.</note> being exactly observed according to the letter and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ministration, though it justified and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them as to the outward enjoyment of Church-hood (for such as were Circumcised and clensed according to the purifications of the law, were a pardoned and an holy people in their Church-estate, and had right to the Rest and Inheritance of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>) yet it was not sufficient of it self, to bring to eternal life and justifie in the sight of God: But such as observed this discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Covenant in a subserviency to the standing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of faith in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> were justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as well as before men.</p>
                           <p>To this end the Apostle and Teacher of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles says,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20</note>
                              <hi>By the deeds of the Law shal no flesh be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> (whether the Law peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the Law common to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) and adds expresly, <hi>(in his sight)</hi> least he should seem to deny, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50669:38"/> remission and holiness which was by the deeds of the Law in the sight of the Church; but he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Justification by them, as the Conscience stands in relation to God, as a Judg that knows the heart: And that the law was thus intended to be but as a discipline, the Apostle shews in the words following, By the law is the knowledge of sin. God did ordain that the Ministration of the law should not only direct them how to be an obedient people, but also to be a means to bring them to know themselves, and so they could not be justified in their own legal righteousness; that so being stung by this fiery serpent, they might fly to Christ, who was to be lifted upon the Cross by his sufferings to take away the curse. This legal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration was only to be an hand maid, and subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to faith the Mistress in the saving Covenant, which Covenant was transacted with them in their Baptism in the Red Sea.</p>
                           <p>Whilst the Jews were thus brought under a new disciplining Covenant, the Gentiles were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their greatest degree of Rejection: For now they are separated from the true Church, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their language, and a mark in the flesh, but by divers laws and observations, which stand as an high wall of partition, to keep them off from Communion with his people, as those that are altogether unclean. And though now they also were grown up into compleat bodys with forms of Church discipline in their degenerate way, yet were they at their greatest distance from God, from Christ and from the true Church. They were strangers from the Life of God, whilst they were strangers from the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel:</hi>
                              <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50669:38"/> They were aliens from the Covenants: for not being included in the Disciplining Covenant, they were out of the saving Covenant by their forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, till they repent. They had no hope of the promise (so it seems best to be read <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <p>In this sad and greatest rejection of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, The Lord left not himself without witness, both of his just proceeding against them, and of his mercy in embracing them, if they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him and lay hold of his Covenant. For though they had not the Law written,<note place="margin">Rom. 18.19.</note> as the Jews had under <hi>Moses,</hi> yet they had the principle of worship and righteousness, even that great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of one God, and one Mediator in their hearts, that is, in their memories by tradition from <hi>Noah.</hi> They had the works of Creation and Providence, especially that late act of Providence in drowning the world of the ungodly, and saving <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, whereof they were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and whereof they had a frequent remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance by the Bow in the Cloud, to teach, exhort and reprove them. They had a Conscience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to accuse and excuse them, together with the patience of God, to lead them to repentance:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.5, 6.</note> Notwithstanding which they had many Gods and many Lords, and Mediators, so corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their imaginations,<note place="margin">Ro. 1.18. <hi>to the end.</hi> Act. 17.22 <hi>to</hi> 31.</note> so neglected to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the work of God, and follow the dictates of their own consciences, that God did justly withdraw his further grace, and left them to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50669:39"/> themselves and the corruptions of their own hearts, and regarded them not as his Church.</p>
                           <p>Yet it pleased him to open such a door of mercy, whereby we may charitably think, if not undoubtedly conclude, That God had a remnant among them in this great Schism, as he had seven thousand in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Schism, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his secret Election, which appears in that it was a truth all the time of their Rejection, That God is no respecter of persons;<note place="margin">Act. 10.34 35.</note> but in every nation he that feareth God &amp; works righteousness is accepted of him.<note place="margin">Ro. 2.26.</note> That if uncircumcision keep the righteouseness of the law, his uncircumcision shall be counted for circumcision: And doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear by the law of the Proselyte: Of whom there were two sorts.</p>
                           <p>The first sort of Proselytes were called <hi>Proselytae foederis</hi> Proselytes of the Covenant.<note place="margin">Lev. 25.6 D. <hi>Lighfort Harmony,</hi> p. 10.</note> Any Gentile strangers who were content to be circumcised; and submit themselves to the whole <hi>Mosaical paedagogy</hi> were to be counted as Jews, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with as freely as those so born.<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Cameron on</hi> Mat. 19.3. P. 175.176</note> The law is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. These (the learned say out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors) were admitted by Baptism, circumcision and an offering. And it is very probable that the admitting a Proselyte by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism as well as circumcision, did arise from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Baptim in the Red Sea: For there were a mixed multitude went up then,<note place="margin">Ex. 12.38.</note> who were with them in the wilderness forty years, whilst circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was suspended,<note place="margin">Jos. 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> And their seed that were left (for the fathers died in the wilderness) might be circumcised at <hi>Gilgal</hi> if they were willing to be the disciples of <hi>Moses</hi> by the law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48 Those needed no Baptism, being Baptised with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50669:39"/> their fathers in the red sea, but other strangers 'tis like were admitted by Baptism and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision as all <hi>Israel</hi> was. The strangers were wont to be numbred, and a view taken of them, it may be for this very reason, to see who were Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, and who not? They were in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, by the numbring wherewith <hi>David</hi> his Father had numbred them, An hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and three thousand and six hundred.</p>
                           <p>The second sort of Proselytes were called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytae portae,</hi> Proselytes of the gate.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 2.17.</note> And Gentile stranger, either so journing with the Jews or not, who received the precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the sum of the standing Covenant of grace, namely one God and one Mediator &amp;c. though they were not Circumcised were yet admitted to bring an offering to the Temple and worship to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the most holy place, which signified one God, one Mediator: Only they were to stand afar of, and not come into the great Court among the body of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> from whom they were at last severed by a partition wall: whence are those expressions, ye that were afar of, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.13. Act. 2.39.</note> So that <hi>Noahs</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism did so far initiate them into the visible Church, that God did accept of them who owned the true Mediator, and walkt according to their light, though they were not Circumcised A plain evidence of Justification in the sight of God by faith without the work of the law; and that God is no respecter of persons upon any account of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges vouchsafed by himself. The truth of this last sort of Proselytes appears by the rule and by examples. The rule is. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.41.42.

                           <p>And of these two sorts of Proselytes, may that of our Saviour be understood, when he denounces wo against the Pharisees,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.15.</note> who were very zealous to make a Proselyte of the first sort, but when they had proselyted them, they made them Jewes of their own sect, not teaching them the end of the law, but to rest in the letter and their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional observations: And so made the condition of the circumcised Proselyte worse than that of the uncircumcised, who was nearer the Kingdom of God in observing the precepts of <hi>Noah</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping afar of (yet by the true Mediator) than the circumcised Pharisaical Proselyte, who rested in the letter of the law: Which is likewise opened by the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25, 26, 27, 28, 29.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</note> Where by uncircumcision, keeping the law, he must needs

                        <p>The Church of the Jews was governed by <hi>Moses</hi> and his laws, from the Baptism in the red sea to our Saviours ascending into Heaven, about fifteen hundred years: In which time the Lord was not wanting to afford all encouragements to be an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and Covenant-keeping people:<note place="margin">Isa. 45.22.24. Ps. 50. Ps. 51.16 17. Ps. 40.6.7.8. Micah. 5.6.7.8.</note> What could I do more for my vineyard then I have done <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. He raised up Judges to deliver them, formed them up to the state of a Kingdom, made them great among the nations, and gave them a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full land: moreover he ordained a glorious priesthood, a sumptuous temple, and did not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his good spirit from them, but sent them prophets to teach them the true meaning and Mysteries of the law, to point them to Christ, whose coming in the flesh, sufferings, resurrection, ascension, and intercession, they foretold, calling them from all false Gods, and false Mediators and not to rest in the literal and external observation of the law, but to look to Christ as the soul and spirit of that dispensation.</p>
                        <p>But they generally transgrest the Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they were Baptised, killing the prophets and sinning against the one only Mediator, by frequent revolting to Idolatry, which especially appeared at the schism of the ten tribes, setting up images of the mercy seate at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> besides that which God had set for them at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and so went a whoring from Christ their husband,<note place="margin">Hos. 1.9.</note> for which the Lord sent the ten tribes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50669:42"/> into an hopeless Captivity,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.10.</note> and they became <hi>Lo ammi</hi> not my people. The two tribes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward falling into the like evils, notwithstanding their often reforming Covenants, God sent them also in Captivity for seventy years, whereby their Idolatry was so far purged, that after their return they never revolted to that sin. But in process of time they fell to another kind of Idolatry and sin against the Mediator, for they did as it were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> looking for Justification in the sight of God by the literal observance of the same, which was a great dishonour to Christ the true Mediator, setting the handmaid above the Mistris, preferring the shadow before the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the shell before the kernal, the vail before the beautiful face it covers, the temporary Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant before the eternal Gospel.<note place="margin">John 9.28.29.

                        <p>In this third Renovation of the Church, Those three things done in the two typical Renovations are here done over again as in the Antitype.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Hence is a Remarkable Judgment on the bastard Churchlings. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the temple is destroyed and the nation scattered.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The standing Covenant of salvation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by water.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A new face of government put upon the Church.</p>
                        <p>The time from our Saviours manifesting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Israel</hi> unto the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was the time of beginning and compleating this work: This space of time was like the time of <hi>Noahs</hi> preparing the Ark, and preaching the coming of the flood on the world of the ungodly. And like the space of <hi>Moses</hi> being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> confirming his call to the <hi>Israelites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to the end he might lead such as Believed of both sorts, to be Baptised in the Sea, and so to go to <hi>Sinai:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A flood of vengeance is coming on the Jews, their old world is to be destroyed, a remnant only to be saved, who must begin a new world: Therefore a new Ark is made, Jesus Christ, openly shewed on the Cross, risen and ascended as the true object of saving faith, a new Church gathered to recieve such as believe: Baptism, an open door for any of Jew or Gentile who embrace Jesus Christ to enter, and be saved from the wrath to come.</p>
                        <p>This was foretold by the prophet <hi>Joel, Chap.</hi> 2. where v. 31. The great and terrible day of the Lord is the day and time of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Joel. 2.31.32.</note> and the temples ruin, and dispersing the nation. There's
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50669:43"/> the Judgment on the degenerate Church. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> Then verse. 32. He that calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved and in Mount <hi>Zion</hi> shall be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.13.14.</note> There's the Ark, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> brings to Baptism and the Gospel Church; thus he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the word <hi>Lord</hi> of Christ, dying and rising, and the word <hi>call</hi> as implying a confessing with the mouth proceeding from belief of the heart, that Christ died and rose again,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> which is solemnly done both to God and men in Baptism: And St. <hi>Peter</hi> saieth plainly, Baptism now laves us, or is our Ark or entrance into it, which is spoken of Baptism re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> as it hath relation to faith in Christ dying and rising again, which faith is evidenced by calling on the Name of the Lord, which is the character of the true Gospel Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. Or the mount <hi>Zion,</hi> where deliverance was promised. And then together with this, verse. 28. The Lord promises to power out his spirit on all flesh &amp;c.<note place="margin">Joel. 2.28.</note> which would bring a new face on the Gospel-Church, and denominate the Ministery a spiritual Ministery or Ministery of the spirit.</p>
                        <p>This gathering a new Church, and powring out a spirit of prophecy did forerun the ruin of City and Temple: For the glorious light of the Gospel by this means, shined as a new Sun in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, darkning and eclipsing the divine light of the ceremonial law, by the Ministery of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. The candle being put out by the greater light the candlestick must be removed. The old Church was now a Mother withered, decrepit, yea dead and must be honourably buried, and the new begins to appear as a Bride beautified with the glory of her husband, the Sun of righteousness, bespangled
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50669:43"/> with a coronet of stars, treading the legal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration under her feet, which was but as the Moon to give a dim light till the Sun arose in Beauty.</p>
                        <p>Christ then constitutes and settles this new Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Church by Baptism.</p>
                        <p>This was either
<list>
                              <item>Common to all the members cald the Baptism or Laver of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Or a being born of water and spirit, or Baptism with water or the baptism of repentance or, into the Name of the Lord Jesus.</item>
                              <item>Peculiar to some for the good of all, called Baptism with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The common Baptism of water is the common en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Christs visible Kingdom, whereby a person is professedly admitted to be Christ disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and professedly engaged to believe his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, be conformable to his likeness, and submit to his Ministery in the Gospel way, as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised were engaged to <hi>Moses</hi> in the legal way; so much putting on of Christ in Baptism signifies. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 27.</p>
                        <p>The peculiar Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with fire, was the giving gifts to some Baptised persons, for the benefit of the rest to be disperst in such a way as Christ himself should appoint, least his holy name be taken in vain.</p>
                        <p>Both these were in the two typical baptisms: For <hi>Noah</hi> and his family were by the flood and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50669:44"/> the ark entred into a new Church, and all that past through the sea were entred members of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Church: And God sent his spirit among them to some prophets and rulers for the good of of the whole. For God never takes a people to be his,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.4.5</note> but he gives them a concurrent Ministery as a means for supply of his grace to perfect the work begun in their first addmittance.</p>
                        <p>But the Holy Ghost, or Baptism of gifts was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be given in the time of the Gospel, as if it had not bin given before 1. Because prophecy was in a manner confined to the circumcision. <hi>Judah</hi> was the valley of vision: The Gentiles sate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the shadow of death: Now in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Church the spirit is given without distinction of persons and places to all flesh, and to some for the good of all that believe. 2. Because the external Ministration of the Gospel doctrine touching Christ dying and rising, is the proper vessel of the spirit of Adoption to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, whereas the outward face of <hi>Moses</hi> his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery was only the vessel and Instrument of the spirit of bondage and fear. In both these respects the promise of the spirit is peculiar to Gospel times; but in other respects the promises of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit have a retrospect as well as a prospect, they look back and shew what the Lord hath done, as well as forward to shew what he will do, as appears by comparing the places of the promises of the spirit together, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.1, 2, 1, 4. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32. with, <hi>Is.</hi> 59.20. The spirit that is on thee shall not depart &amp;c.</p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:50669:44"/>
                        <p>For the better understanding of both these Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms, they are to be considered in their several editions, both in their first and original use, and in their continued use in the Church of God.</p>

                           <p>The forming the Gospel Church proceeded by a preparatory, and consummatory work.<note place="margin">Mar. 1.1, 2. Act. 1.1.2.5.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>The preparatory work was from <hi>Johns</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to preach and baptise, until our Lords ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into Heaven, during which time the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law and difference twixt Jew and Gentile was yet standing.</p>
                           <p>This preparatory work had also two degrees. The one from <hi>Johns</hi> beginning to preach and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, to Christs manifesting himself to <hi>Israel,</hi> and the other from his being Baptised or publike Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation,<note place="margin">Act. 19.4.</note> to his ascension.</p>
                           <p>For <hi>John</hi> preacht Repentance in order to the remission of sins,<note place="margin">1 John. 1.33, 34, 35, 36.37.</note> which should be obtained by him that should shortly appear but was not yet revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And when Christ was revealed to him by the signal of the holy Ghost ascending on him at his Baptism, <hi>John</hi> pointed to him in sight of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, saying, Behold the Lamb of God and bear his testimony of him, That Christ must increase but he must decrease, and was presently cast in prison, and so finisht his Ministery. So that those that were Baptised by <hi>Johns</hi> personal Ministery were not to profess their faith in Christ himself, but their repentance in expectation of him.</p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:50669:45"/>
                           <p>Where S. <hi>John</hi> ends, Christ and his Disciples begin and preach the same thing, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand: illustrating the state of the Kingdom by divers lively parables. And they carry on this preparatory work one degree fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">John 4.2.</note> still as members of the Jewish Church. Christ himself does not initiate Disciples by water, but his Disciples are put upon that work as of a more inferior nature, reserving to himself the work of preaching and doing miracles, and the baptising with the holy ghost:<note place="margin">John 8.24</note> But the Disciples preach now, that this Jesus is the Christ, for Savour now told the Jews, except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins: And he had instructed his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the present truth,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.15.16.</note>
                              <hi>To believe that he was the Christ, the Son of the Living God, and bid them what they heard in secret to preach on the house tops.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Disciples therefore baptised into Christ as being revealed, but not as having finished the work of our redemption, and confined this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Jews.</p>
                           <p>When our blessed Saviour was risen and ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the spirit given: Now the foundation was fully laid for the compleat constitution of the Gospel-Church; By Baptism with water to enter into the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19</note> and by giving the holy Ghost to plant a spiritual Ministry for the continual watering the Church to grow up a new and spiritual temple:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.16. Act. 18.25, 26. &amp; 19.3, 4.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptism with water, issues forth upon a new Commission, with different priviledges and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies above <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism: So as the state of the Gospel-Church before Christs Resurrection is denoted as the time of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism and of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50669:45"/> Christs being in the flesh, as of a time of the first and imperfect draught or edition of the Gospel-Church, when it was but as it were an <hi>embrio,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under the legal dispensation. But the state of the Chuch after the Ascension is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this, that now we know Christ no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh, all things are become new: The Kingdom of Heaven, which <hi>John</hi> and our blessed Saviour whilst they were in the flesh preached was at hand, is now come.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>This excellency above S.</hi> Johns <hi>Baptism appears in some particulars.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. Now after Christs Ascension, The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> In thee shall all Nations be blessed, comes actually to be fulfilled. The state of the Church which our Saviour so oft calls the Kingdom of Heaven comes openly on the stage. The blessing promised to all Nations, was the compleating Remission of Sin by the death of Christ, and giving forth the spirit to soften mens hearts and enlighten their minds to make them new, and bring them from Satan to God, which now comes to be bestowed on all Nations, through Jesus Christ the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the right hand of the Father.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Now the Object of Faith compleated: For though Faith be one in the general nature of it in all Ages; yet the object or thing to be believed, differs according to the manner, and measure of Revelation, according to which the present truth in every age is the word of Faith:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.8.</note> So that when our Saviour was in the flesh, the Object of Faith was not Christ, dead, risen and ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that this was He, who was come to do
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50669:46"/> the will of God here on earth, though they yet know not how: But now the Object of Faith is, That God hath made good his promise in sending Christ, and Christ hath done the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all things. Before the Gospel was in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tense, now 'tis in the preterperfect tense, the time perfectly past. Before the Gospel was much in hopes of a <hi>Messiah,</hi> now in the possession and enjoyment of him, not as he was in the Law, but as he is present in his Church in a spiritual dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. And as the Prophet says, after their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in <hi>Babylon;</hi> it shall be no more said, The Lord liveth who brought you out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but the Lord liveth who brought you out of the Land of the North: So now it is no more said, The Lord liveth who brought out of the Land of the North: but who delivered from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himself, and lead our spiritual Captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. It is no more said, The Lord liveth who hath taken our nature in the form of a servant, and is become obedient unto death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Lord liveth who is risen from the dead, is ascended into Heaven and hath given gifts to men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Col. 2.2. Eph. 2.4. 2 Cor. 13.14.</note>Now the <hi>Mystery of the Father and of the Son is fully revealed. The Father,</hi> His wisdom, and the riches of his mercy and kindness in providing and sending such a Saviour so mighty to save. In whom his Majesty is so well pleased that he hath exalted him at his own right hand. <hi>The Son,</hi> His grace, goodness and love to mankind to take his Nature and Union with the Word, and to do the will of his Father in descending to assume our nature,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.16 1 Joh. 1.3.</note> consecrate it to God, and glorifie it in the Heavens. <hi>The holy Spirit</hi> is now revealed, as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50669:46"/> proceeding from the Father, and the Son at the request of the Son to the Father.<note place="margin">Phil. 6, 7.</note> His communion is revealed as by whom alone we are brought to enjoy fellowship with the Father and the Son, and not by legal and external works. And by the communication of whose gifts we enjoy fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship one with another, as becomes the Gospel, and all difference twixt Jew and Gentile in point of Communion taken away.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Now after Christs ascension the name of Baptism is altered: Before, it was called the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism of <hi>John:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Act. 2.38.8.16.19.5.</note> now 'tis Baptism into the Name of the Lord Jesus, that is, to be Disciples under the Name and Profession of Jesus Christ, who is now manifested to be Lord and Mediatour, by his ascending into Heaven, and giving forth his Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Form and Manner of Baptism differs from <hi>John.</hi> We know not indeed the very Form of words used by S. <hi>John</hi> at the application of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or whether he used any certain Form or no: But this seems certain that he preached the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Repentance for the Remission of Sin,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.11.</note> which seems to signifie, that in Preaching Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he Baptised, and Baptising he Preached Repentance, and explained the meaning and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of his Ministry, saying, I Baptise you with Water unto Repentance: but he that comes after me is mightier than I, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring particular belief in the Son and Spirit.</p>
                           <p>But after our Saviours Ascension he expresly commands Baptism to be in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50669:47"/> Son, and Spirit, this mystery being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: Not that this form consisted only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing these words at the application of water, but this should if need be, be doctrinally taught and practically exercised, in calling on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Mediation of the Son (who was dead and is alive) by the assistance of the spirit, and openly professed in the time of Baptism. So that though this Baptism is not the very Baptism with the Holy Ghost, the emblem whereof was fire, yet this was ordinarily requisite to go before the Baptism of gifts, as laying a foundation for it: Because Baptism with wather is an evidence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, not only in the Father, but also in the Son, ascended into Heaven, and in the Holy Ghost, who is given to them that believe, and obey according to the measure of the gift of Christ. And without this faith the spirit was not given.</p>
                           <p>That this was the order we may see by the promise,<note place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> Be Baptised and ye shall receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised spirit, and by the example of the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Disciples, who after they were Baptised with water into the name of the Lord Jesus,<note place="margin">Act. 8.14, 15, 16.</note>
                              <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> came from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to pray that they might recieve the Holy Ghost. And the twelve at <hi>Ephesus</hi> who recieved the Holy Ghost by <hi>Pauls</hi> hands,<note place="margin">Act. 19.5.6.</note> were first Baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus: For whereas some learned men do think being Baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus, in that place is a periphrasis of <hi>Johns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and relates to <hi>Johns</hi> personal baptism: it seems a mistake, and a needles criticism. For Baptism into the name of the Lord Jesus is a phrase pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Baptism commanded by Christ after his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50669:47"/> resurrection which is in a Contradistinction to <hi>Johns</hi> and was a necessary foundation for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the spirit. And the Criticism is needless be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though these twelve might be Baptised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism, because it was necessary they should profess their faith in Christ ascended before they could receive the spirit: Yet it will not follow that Baptism once into the name of the Father, Son and Spirit, may be repeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking the name of God in vain.</p>
                           <p>Nevertheles, though the Church was tied to expect the Holy Ghost only by being first Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised with water into the name of the Lord Jesus, yet the Lord is not tied himself by his own order; for <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his freinds, received the Holy Ghost before they were Baptised with water: Which the Lord was pleased to do as a witness from Heaven of accepting such as believe, Gentile as well as Jew.<note place="margin">Act. 10.44 to the end.</note> And to take away all scruple of receiving them into the Gospel Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, can any forbid water that these should not be Baptised, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? as if he should say. If God accepts them why should not we?</p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism did not make any separation from the Jewish Church. They that were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised might circumcise their Children, eat the passover, be cleansed according to the law, yea they were bound to do it. Our Saviour himselfe did not form a Society in a way of distinction from the Temple Communion but only laid in some principles and made as it were a <hi>Sciagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> a shady description of the new Church, whilst the old Church was standing: But now
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50669:48"/> after the Ascension there is a new Church Society erected with a word of distinction and separation; Save your selves from this untoward generation:<note place="margin">Acts. 2.40</note> Who out of a blind zeal to the law of <hi>Moses</hi> have rejected the <hi>Messias,</hi> and the was of Justification by his grace, therefore you that look for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him alone must not hold Communion with them. They may come to you, but you may not go to them, who are now a people set apart for destruction.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Therefore Baptism after the Ascension doth take away Circumcision, which confind Church-hood to one nation, and becomes in stead thereof a comman sign to all nations, that God will be their God and the God of their seed in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations keeping Covenant and embracing the present truth of the Gospel, as it is revealed, and to that end will give his Holy Spirit among them, for a supply of his grace in the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Ministery in all ages. For Baptism in <hi>Johns</hi> time was not urged upon the Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Circumcision was in force, and that was sufficient to seal the Covenant to the infant seed. But when the spirit was given, and the Kingdom of Heaven came to all nations, Circumcision was virtually dead, and no more to be taken notice of, and such a sign of Initiation to be used as might have relation to the promise of the spirit, which was Baptism into the name of the Father, Son and Spirit, that so the New Church might be founded in the Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and spiritual government of our Lord Jesus; and not in the carnal, weak and obscure or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of <hi>Moses.</hi> So that the establishing this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50669:48"/> Baptism was the immediate eradicating of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</p>
                           <p>Hereupon, because the standing Covenant doth continue under this new Ministration,<note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> therefore the Apostles both by warrant of their commission, and in their practice, do administer Baptism in the same extent as Circumcision was administred for the continuance of the Church in the seed of the first Believers to all generations. As will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the story of their Baptisings.</p>
                           <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> at the planting of the first Church of the Jews,<note place="margin">Act. 2, 38.39.</note> exhorts them saying—Be Baptised every one of you—for the promise is made to you and your children &amp;c. This latter sentence or reason doth manifestly shew that <hi>every one of you,</hi> is not to be taken only individually but collectively and is as much as every one of you and your children who are in your power; for the duty and the promise are of like extent. The promise is Remission of sin, that what is past shall not be charged, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is the blessing of the Gospel Ministery, a sign of Gods presence in the Church, and owning his people in their generations: So that it is as much as if he had said, Do you and your seed come into Christ, which is signified by Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus, and God will own you for his people still, and continue his visible Church-hood among you and your seed in this Gospel-dispensation, according to the promise made to your Father <hi>Abraham.</hi> For the blessing promised to all nations, does in the fist place concern you his naturall seed.<note place="margin">Act. 3.25.26.</note>
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25, 26. Only you must repent of what is past, and you
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50669:49"/> and your seed must be Baptised, and cast off cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, which besides that it was a seal of the standing Covenant, was also an engagement to the whole law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.19. Gal. 5.6. Gal. 5.2.3</note> And therefore it is now become as nothing or of no effect: And it is now a great truth if ye be circumcised, and stand upon the necessity of continuance of it, Christ shall profit you nothing: For then you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the whole law, and that is in effect to deny Christ to be come in the flesh, for it takes away the end of his coming: but if you will be Baptised God will continue to be your God and the God of your seed in their generations keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and so all things will become new to you. Otherwise you and your posterity will become rejected as it came to pass in those who submitted not to Baptism.</p>
                           <p>Touching this taken away of circumcision, we may remember by the way, That there was a time when it was not only lawful but necessary, and a time when it was lawful but not necessary, and a time when it was neither lawful nor neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. It was not only lawful but necessary as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty commanded, till our Saviours ascending into Heaven, after which the obligation to it as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ceased,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.4.</note> but it remained under a liberty as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the ceremonial law, which might be made use of to avoyd the exasperating the Jews for a while, till the doctrine of the Gospel was fully preached; on which account <hi>Paul</hi> Circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> and says to the Jews he became as a Jew that he might gain the Jews, who were yet to be Judged weak but not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate: And therefore such as believed and out
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50669:49"/> of weakness observed some of the ordinances, not yet having so much faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.1</note> as to see that Christ had set them fre were to be born with. But when some Christian Jews began to stand upon it as a necessary duty it became unlawful: For circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and baptism could not stand together:<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1, 2.3, 4.</note> Baptism was sufficient, and the proper sign of Gods fixing his Covenant of Church-hood with believers and their generations of any nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven.</p>
                           <p>As <hi>Peter</hi> laid the foundation of the Gospel-Church of the Jews in the union of Baptised families. In like manner did <hi>Paul</hi> for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Gentiles and owns it as a recieved prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, That the Children of Believers are holy.</p>
                           <p>This appears in planting the Church of <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> the beginning whereof was <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houshold Baptised:<note place="margin">Act. 16.14, 15, 33.</note> The Jaylor and all his Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Also in planting the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> it is said <hi>Crispus</hi> believed with all his houshold, and many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> believed and were Baptised;<note place="margin">Act. 18.7, 8, 9, 10.11</note> where the words many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the full sence to the former part of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and must signifie many of like sort with <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spus,</hi> many with their housholds, As the verb, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, in the latter part of the sentence is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the former, and so in the full sence it may be read thus,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 14, 16.</note>
                              <hi>Crispus with all his houshold believed and was Baptised and many of the Corinthians with their houshold believed also and were Baptised, Crispus,</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> and <hi>Justus,</hi> probably, with their families are mentioned by name that we may understand that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Church was in the uniting of families
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50669:50"/> in the Christian Faith, of which there were many in that Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.14.</note> for God had told <hi>Paul</hi> he had much people in that city and therefore he stayed there a year and six monethes. And in his Epistle to this Chuch he asserts this as a principle, That the children of believers are of the visible Church with them according to the ancient tenor of the covenant I am thy God, and the God of thy seed, the old standing covenant in the Church of God.</p>
                           <p>That the Apostle brings in this as a Principle, may thus appear.</p>
                           <p>The question was whether a believer having an unbelieving yoke-fellow was not bound to put her away and her children, if she had any: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this scruple seems this, The believing <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> being studious in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Ezr. 9.1, 2.3, 4. &amp; 10 Chap.</note> and zealous to know the will of God in all things found in the book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> that the having of strange wives, such as were out of the Church, was a great transgression, and the wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by them put away as unclean: whereupon they might well scruple whether they ought not to put away such wives: The Apostle answers they are not bound to put them away, unless such wives do put away themselves, and bring this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove it. If by that Law in <hi>Ezra</hi> you should put away such wives, then you must put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the children begotten of them as being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Churchlings,<note place="margin">Ezr. 9.2. &amp; 10.3.</note> and not a right seed, for God had forbid them to marry with the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> But this was not the rule the believing Gentiles must go by. The ancient Law of the Proselyte
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50669:50"/> must be their rule, whose Males and in them the whole feed were holy to God, and circumcised with him, though it may be the wife were not proselyted. So believing Gentiles were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else than as Proselytes, and therefore their seed holy, and of the Church, though their wives continue in unbelief. Wherefore when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, But now your children are holy, his meaning is, That the children of a believer by an unbeliever are not unclean, or bastard Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to be put away as the seed of the Jews by the strange nations whom God had forbidden to marry with by a particular Law, but an holy seed or a seed of the Church.</p>
                           <p>The word <hi>(Now)</hi> in that Text doth either signifie change of time, and then it holds out, that now in the time of the Gospel that Law in <hi>Ezra</hi> of prohibiting to marry with those strangers is of no use; or else it is a note of the Assumption or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> Proposition in the Argument (as it, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. compared with 17. <hi>v.</hi>) And then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument stands thus.</p>
                           <p>If believers are to put away their unbelieving wives, then their children also born of them, are to be put away as unclean.</p>
                           <p>But now the children of believers are not to be put away as unclean, As appears by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Law of the Proselyte, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ergo,</hi> such wives are not to be put away.</p>
                           <p>If <hi>(Now)</hi> be taken either way, This Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is asserted, That the children of believers are holy: As a principle of the Gospel-Church, and needs no proof and was a sufficient rule to decide that controversie.</p>
                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:50669:51"/>
                           <p>This being the Apostles practice in these two Churches, It is to be presumed, it was his uniform practice in all. Moreover, this practice will lead us to understand the rule our Saviour gave for planting Churches,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19. Mar. 16.15, 16.</note> and Commission for Baptising all Nations according to that practice; for there is no doubt but the Apostles practised according to their Commission, which Rule and Commission set down in the Evangelists sounds to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Go and Preach it to Jews and Gentiles, that the Messiah so often promised,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Christs-Commission to baptise extends to a believer and all his.</note>
                              <hi>and so long expected is come, and hath done the will of his Father in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their sins, and rising again for their justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> And being ascended to his Fathers right hand hath sent down his spirit on the Gentiles as well as the Jews to let all the world know, that it is his will and pleasure, there should be no longer any difference between them, by any partition-wall; but that they should be one Church, one Spirit, one Body, and hath given one spiritual Ministry to them all, to build them up as a new and holy Temple: Whosoever therefore of Jew or Gentile will believe the truth of these things, and signifie the truth of his belief, desiring that he and all his should become my Disciples, such with all theirs you shall receive to Baptism, and by Baptism admit to my visible Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whereby they may at present be accounted in a saved state and way. And (answering the means of Grace, I shall afford them by my spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Gospel-Ministry) may be eternally saved from the wrath that is to come, for in <hi>Zion</hi> God hath promised salvation. And by this means the blessing of <hi>Abraham</hi> shall come on all Nations.<note place="margin">Joel 2 32.</note>
                           </p>
                           <pb n="93" facs="tcp:50669:51"/>
                           <p>That the word [He that believes and is Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed] is to be taken thus in a Collective, Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or comprehensive sence for [He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is Baptised with all His] <hi>will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> if we consider.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The blessing of Baptism is declared in that comprehensive manner. The Angel told <hi>Cornelius</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> should tell him words whereby he and all his house should be saved.<note place="margin">Act. 11.14.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. Baptism is exhorted to in the like compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive terms, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, and all thine house:</hi> in obedience whereunto the Jaylor was baptised and all his straitway.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. 'Tis Gods manner in the Old Testament,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.6.</note> when he speaks of covenant-transactions with his his people to speak in this collective and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive manner, as I said unto thee in thy blood live, that is I took thee and thy posterity in thee to be my Church. It is explained to <hi>Abraham</hi> that when God says, Thou shallt keep my Covenant, tis meant thou and thy seed after thee.<note place="margin">Gen. 7.9.13.</note> And he that is born in thy house is he and his seed after him must needs be circumcised.<note place="margin">Hos. 12.4.</note> Therefore the posterity of the Church look on themselves as concerned in the transactions of God with their Ancestors. God found <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> saith <hi>Hosea,</hi> and there he spake with us,<note place="margin">Ex. 20.10.</note> who were then only in <hi>Jacobs</hi> loins. Thus the word, Thou in the commandments signifies politically, thou thy Son, and thy Daughter and all within thy gates, or within thy power.<note place="margin">Ex. 12.48.</note> And thus the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50669:52"/> Proselyte if he were circumcised himself and not his males, he might not eat the passover, but was as one uncircumcised.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. In like manner in the new Testament the Baptism of the houshold is comprehended when the Father of the family is said to be Baptised.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.14.16.</note>
                              <hi>Paul</hi> saies he Baptised <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Gaius</hi> and the houshold of <hi>Stephanus.</hi> It is manifest he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the houshold of <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Gaius</hi> under their names from <hi>Act.</hi> 18.8. It seems it was a thing so frequent to Baptise housholds or families, that it was enough to say <hi>Crispus</hi> is Baptised, when one would intend to say his family is Baptised, and that, he that had a family was not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted baptised by his own single baptism unless he brought such as were in his power, with him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>By housholds</hi> we are not necessarily to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all and every one in the house. For there might be an unbelieving wife, or a son grown up not in the Power of the Parent. But such either of his Children, as being in their Minority could not will, or chuse for themselves, or other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to whom he was Guardian, who were in the power of his education, or persons that were wholy in his power as his goods being born in his house, or bought with his moneys (of which there were many in those days) being in their minority: Or if at years of understanding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wife or others if he did what he could to perswade (not violently compel) them. So that if any such did refuse,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> yet because he had done his duty and testified his faith by bringing in such as were in his power that so his family might be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50669:52"/> said a family fearing God, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> was; he is said to be Baptised with all his, and says with <hi>Joshua</hi> I and my house, we will serve the Lord.</p>
                           <p>The reason of this first gathering the Gospel-Church by the Children, and houshold of first believers is intimated by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the third <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.28, 29.</note> After he had asserted that so many as were Baptised into Christ had put on Christ <hi>v.</hi> 27. And those many were families as well as single persons of Jew or Gentile <hi>v.</hi> 28. He argues thus <hi>v.</hi> 29. Those that are Baptised into Christ are Christs, that is <hi>of him, belonging to him</hi> or of <hi>his family and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> If they be Christs then are they <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, (not natural but adopted by divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution) If <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, then Heirs according to promise. Now what was that promise, but that as God was the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed in the legal dispensation: So he will be the God of Jew and Gentile and their seed, in the Gospel dispensatoin; and accordingly give them his spirit to fit them for eternal life: For he says <hi>v.</hi> 9. That they that believe are blessed with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, with like blessings as he was blessed withal.</p>
                           <p>And thus the first believers of the Gentiles were as so many <hi>Abrahams,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Luk. 19.9.</note> or Sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> beginning a new Church in respect of the way and manner of dispensation, but continuing the old in the standing priviledges of it (by the grace and grant of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father) and deriving the blessing of Church-hood in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-way to their houses and families, keeping Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50669:53"/> from generation to generation without any Interruption of Church-hood in that space of time wherein the change was made from <hi>Moses</hi> to Christ.</p>
                           <p>And those first believers of Jews and Gentiles are a first fruits unto God in whom the lump of their posterity is sanctified: And a prognostick sign that there is a fulness of both to come in to God in his due time, though many branches of both,<note place="margin">Ro. 11.16. Ro. 11.12.25. James. 1.18. Ro. 15.16.</note> are some broken of, some not grafted in: And a ground of hope that both shall be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> of the Gospel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted and so all <hi>Israel</hi> saved by one Baptismal Covenant.</p>
                           <p>This is that good work which <hi>Paul</hi> thanks God for,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.5.6.</note> begun among the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the first day of their fellowship in the Gospel,<note place="margin">Act. 16.12.13, 14, 15, 33.</note> wherein <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the Jaylor with all theirs recieved the Gospel and were Baptised, whereupon he declares his confidence that the Lord would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it on to a day of perfection in Christ both in adding more persons and families to the Church, that it should be to the Lord as a generation. And also in carying on their good desires to a stablishment in grace in the of way a Church and Christian education.</p>
                           <p>How Baptism with water is Continued.</p>
                           <p>The first Gospel-Churches, being thus planted and constinuted in a company of believers, and their housholds compacted together by Baptism with water into the name of the Lord Jesus into one visible body, whereof every particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50669:53"/> was a member, and furnished with a Ministery by the Immediate gift of the spirit: It remains to consider how this Baptism and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery is continued in the generations of the faithful. For there is not altogether the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the first believers and first Ministery as of these believers and that Ministery that does succeed.</p>
                           <p>The substance of the first constitution, namely Baptism into the name of the Lord Jesus, or into the name of the Father, Son and Spirit, with a confession of saith agreeable thereunto. And a Ministery of gifts to declare the Mystery of the Gospel and apply it to the necessity of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in all the ways which Christ hath appointed for their edification, must needs be continued, as a visible mark of their Church-hood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the Covenant. But in respect of some circumstances there must be some variation, yet only such as the reason of the thing leads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                           <p>As it was when God formed his Church a new in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, and appointed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, the visible mark of Church hood, it was necessary that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith should eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and actually appear, as a pattern and copy for his posterity to follow, whereupon he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self recieved circumcision when he was old, and the rest of his family taken into Covenant with him at several ages: But the mark of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his faith, was continued in his Infant seed. And the actual profession of such as were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in Infancy did appear when they had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by their obedience to Gods command in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50669:54"/> dedicating their children to God, and so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profession of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation.</p>
                           <p>In the like manner in the first forming the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Church,<note place="margin">Jude. 3. Jer. 6.26. Eph. 3.5. with Eph. 2.7.</note> It was needful the first Receivers of the Gospel should be persons eminent, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in the faith: For the saith first given and recieved by the first Saints and Forefathers is a rule for the succeeding ages to walk after, and is incumbent upon them, to make profession of in their generations: But the profession of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the faith of the farefathers is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly made at the Infancy of Church members; partly because it continues a duty still as well as of old, for parents to dedicate their children to Christ, to be educated in his schoool from the first: Partly because they that have children, may have a fit occasion to declare their personal owning of their Baptismal profession: And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the united company of believers may witness their Joint Continuance in the faith of Christ.</p>
                           <p>So that the Baptising infants of the Church is not upon any account of their own actual faith, being altogether passive, but on the account of their Parents, or Guardians together with the Church (which is a common parent to all her members) their profession to continue in the faith of the first Churches their forefathers; and this faith shews it self by this work of faith in enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their children by baptism,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19. with. Deut. 6.3. and 7. Eph. 6 4.</note> in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and themselvs to educate them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Lord hath commanded Church members to be both in the old and new Testament, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50669:54"/> upon that account is pleased to continue his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore did God threaten to slay <hi>Moses</hi> for not circumcising his child?<note place="margin">Ex. 4.24.</note> but because he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by neglected a profession of his faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in engageing his child to God.<note place="margin">Ex. 12.48.</note> Why was the circumcised Proselyte counted as uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unless his males were circumcised:<note place="margin">Mark. 16.16</note> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the profession of his faith was not full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he gave his children to God. And if when our Saviour Joyns faith and baptism together, the word <hi>He</hi> is to be taken, not only in a single but also a collective sence (as hath been declared) it will follow that the presenting children to God will come in as a witness of the parents faith.</p>
                           <p>And that the child is thus engaged by the Churches &amp; Parents act is evident not only by the law of nature,<note place="margin">John 9, 21</note> which counts children in Infancy as part and members of their parents, and as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no will of their own, but parents will for them in all things, that seriously concern them, as Food, Raiment, Physick, Education, Trades, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions: But also by the innate custom of Church-hood as in cases of vows to God, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in mariage, donation of lands and revenews to the use of the Church:<note place="margin">Gen. 21. Ezra 9.27.28. Nehem. 10.28.</note>

                           <p>When our Saviour not only appoints teaching before baptism in order to the baptising the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> But also to teach the baptised Nations after baptism to observe his commands, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimates there should be an education in Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Principles from Infancy, as well as in legal Principles in time of <hi>Moses</hi> which education doth necessarily suppose baptism as a part of it, and Introduction to it, as Circumcision was to the legal education. It is part of the nurture of the Lord which Christian Parents owe to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

                              <note place="margin">Mat. 9.2.</note>When our Saviour interprets the action of those that brought the sick of the palsey, uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the roofe to come to him, to be an evidence of their faith: And the Action of such as brought children to him to be blessed an evidence of the faith of them that brought them,<note place="margin">Mark. 10.13, 14, 15,</note> and as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens own coming to him being so brought by them in whose power they were, and commands that such actions should not be forbidden, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were suitable to his Kingdom: He doth plainly enough intimate what would be pleasing to him in the continuance of Baptism after the first plantation.</p>
                           <p>If Baptism should not be thus nationally or generationally continued, what great chasms and breaches would there be in Gods dispensation of the visible covenant. The children of believers would not be the children of the Church, and no more under their care, than Pagans and Infidels: They would be left to themselves to choose their own religion, and then how easily are they tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to any other than the Christian, which hath

                           <p>The whole work and procedure of the Gospel is summarily comprehended in Baptism in Water, and Baptism in Fire. Our blessed Saviour himself is first baptised in Water and then in Fire by the descending of the Holy Ghost upon him, so ful-filling all the righteousness of the Gospel. The Apostles having been Baptised with Water, were Baptised in Fire at the time of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> And all the first Churches after they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptised in Water, received the Holy Ghost by the hands and prayers of the Apostles. To signifie unto us that the state of a Christian is not compleat in the Gospel-dispensation unless he be baptised in Water and in Fire: which our Saviour declares to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (a man who it was very probable, was baptised in Water, and had now a great opinion that he was a compleat Disciple) saying, Except a man be born again (not only of Water) but also of the Holy Ghost he cannot enter (fully and compleatly enter) into the Kingdom of God.</p>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50669:56"/>
                           <p>The Baptism of Water unto Repentance and the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and of Fire are not properly two kinds of Baptism, but as two degrees of the same Baptism, and only distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished as weaker and stronger Fire not opposed to Water as destructive, but as perfective of that whose foundation and ground work is laid in the weakness of Water, and is the same distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Apostle gives in other words, when he says, Godliness hath a Form and a Power, or when a man is said to consist of a body and a soul, flesh and spirit.</p>
                           <p>Baptism hath an outward Form, and is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by S. <hi>John,</hi> which is but a weak Ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And it hath an inward power for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating a Christian state ministred only by Christ himself, who S. <hi>John</hi> says is stronger than he.</p>
                           <p>Baptism with water implies the beginning state of a Christian, and of a Church: Baptism with fire the compleat state. Baptism with Water affords the materials of the visible Church: Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism with fire the inward Form, and is as the soul to the body.</p>
                           <p>As the natural body of <hi>Adam</hi> was first formed of Earth in all its parts, and then enlivened and strengthned by a Breath from God: So the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body of Christ is formed of this spiritual wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and put into all its lively motions by a Breath of fire from Christ himself.</p>
                           <p>As in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple there was the sacrifice
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50669:57"/> and the fire from Heaven to burn in the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to make it acceptable: So in the spiritual and visible Temple built by our greater than <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> there's the water whereby persons of all nations are offered to God, and the fire from Heaven to burn in this sacrifice, which whilst it is kept burning in the Church, and not changed nor extinguisht makes themselves and their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices a sweet Saviour unto God.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Baptism with water proceeded from two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> First from <hi>John</hi> under whose Ministery it was whilst the word of the Gospel was the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is at hand. But after the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven was coms at Christs resurrection, it flows forth from himself which he ordains to be used with a <hi>new and enlarged object</hi> of faith, whence it was cald Baptism into the name of the Lord Jesus, who was now to be confessed to be risen and ascended to the Fathers right hand: And upon a <hi>new enlarged subject</hi> of all Nations: And to a <hi>new enlarged end,</hi> That all Nations might be capable of the gift of the Holy Ghost, which they could not be unless they received Christ as ascended into heaven: For the giving of the Holy Ghost being the greatest and most famous miracle that Christ ever did, it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Faith to make us capable to receive it.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, <hi>Baptism with water since Christs ascension may receive this description:</hi> Baptism with water, or the outward form of Baptism is an Ordinance of Christ whereby by the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of men, in the use of water, persons and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50669:57"/> of any Nation under Heaven, receiving Jesus Christ risen and ascended by an open and solemn profession are received into Christ, as members of his visible body, and made thereby capable of the blessing of the Holy Ghost or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism in fire,<note place="margin">Act. 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. S. <hi>Paul</hi> finds certain Disciples, and enquires whether they had received the Holy Ghost since they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. They answer they had not so much as heard there was an Holy Ghost: He said unto them, unto what then were ye baptised? they said unto <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism, &amp;c. Here these things are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That the calling them Disciples, supposed them baptised with water.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That after our Saviours ascension, the Holy Ghost was usually given to compleat the work begun in Baptism with water.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism did not make persons capable of the Holy Ghost, because it extended not to the belief of Christ glorified, which must necessarily go before receiving the Holy Ghost promised.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That Baptism with water into the name of the Lord Jesus, or into the name of the Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Son, and now manifested since Christs ascending into Heaven, did ordinarily precede the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Baptism with the Holy Ghost and Fire doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> a work or dispensation peculiar to Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the Shepherd and Bishop of Souls: and it contains two things especially:</p>
                           <pb n="106" facs="tcp:50669:58"/>
                           <p>First the power of Regeneration in all that truly believe in Christ risen from the dead.</p>
                           <p>Secondly ministerial gifts given to men for promoting that power of Regeneration.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>The power of Regeneration is signified by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.5. Joh 2.13,</note> John</hi> 3.5, 10. or <hi>being born of God, John</hi> 2.13. The outward formal and ministerial work is called a being born of water. The ministerial birth by water in Baptism is teaching, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to newness of life by word and sign, water and washing, confessions, promises, obligations prayers and thanksgivings, &amp;c. The power of this birth is the blessing of Christ on the ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dispensation, which blessing is a breathing from himself on the soul, which is like fire, that kindles and sheds the true love of God into the heart, whereby the mind is enlightned to see the riches of the grace of God in Christ and the purpose fixt and cleave to the Lord and the heart stablisht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all tentations being now sealed, with this powerful work of Christs own spirit: This is called by <hi>Peter,</hi> The answer of a good conscience toward God.</p>
                           <p>This stablishing work is promised, or rather prophesied of, to be given to the sincere believer,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33.32.40.</note>

                           <p n="2">2. <hi>The Baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the giving ministerial gifts,</hi> to some for the benefit of all, which was the fruit of that solemn Baptism in Fire in the day of <hi>Pentecost.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>These gifts are sometime described by names of office, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, Teachers: sometime by the manifestation of the Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. as a word of Wisdom, a word of Knowledg, Faith, gift of Healing, working of Miracles, Prophecy, discerning of Spirits, Tongues, interpretation of Tongues.</p>
                           <p>But the ministerial Spirit in the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire is compendiously set forth by <hi>Propheey,</hi> which doth not only signifie predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but that which is set forth by a word of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and a word of knowledg, and knowledg-ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5.

                           <p n="2">2.

                           <p>By this Baptism of gifts a prophetical Ministry was establish'd in the Gospel-Church in stead of the Priestly,<note place="margin">Isa. 66.21.

                           <p>The excellency of this Gospel-prophecying Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry is with much divine eloquence set forth by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who much delighted to magnifie his Office,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.13, 18.</note> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13, and 18. He compares the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Ministry with <hi>Moses</hi> as equal in revelations, but far superior in the glory and efficacy of their Ministration. They were equal in this that the mystery of Christ was a fully revealed to them by the baptism of the Spirit, as it was to <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount, when God spake face to face to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50669:59"/> him, and they as much transformed by it as he was, when his face shone in the eyes of the people: But herein the glory and power of the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ministry far exceeds <hi>Moses.</hi> For <hi>Moses</hi> shining face, being covered with a vail, did not cause any shining in others that look'd upon it, the spirit of Regeneration and Adoption was not conveyed in that Ministry. But in the Apostolical Ministry the face of Christ being openly shewed, it becomes a transforming Ministry from Glory in the speaker, to Glory in the hearer.</p>

                           <p>For the Conclusion of this Baptismal history, there remains only to observe the correspondency of Christian Baptism, the Antitype with the other typical Baptisms: Which appears in <hi>the manner and the end.</hi>

                              <hi>These four things in the manner of Noahs Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism</hi> may be observed to be declared touching the Christian Baptism, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Here is a special, or new word of faith to be believed in order to Christian Baptism: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Christ is risen, and hath done the will of the Father, which the stubborn Jews rejected: But they that embraced this truth were tried and eminent believers, as <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were, and so fit for the fundamentals of this new Church.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Here is a word of command for such Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and all their's of all Nations to go into the Ark and be Baptised, that they may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Here is a transaction of a Covenant by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50669:62"/> For it is manifest that water was used after Christs ascending into Heaven, <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.26. See here is water, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. Can any forbid water <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. Wash away thy sins in calling on the Name of the Lord. And it was used with Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, professions engagements, prayers and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal applications as a seal of all, wherein are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teaching and promising signs on Gods part, and professing and obliging signs on our part.</p>
                           <p>By the washing and plunging in water is taught,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17. Rom. 6.4. Col. 3, 9.</note> That he that is in Christ must be a new Creature. The filth of the old <hi>Adam</hi> must be washt away, dead and buried, and the holiness of the new and second <hi>Adam</hi> must be put on as a new garment, and the Baptised be as one risen from the dead</p>
                           <p>By the application of water,<note place="margin">Ezech. 3.6 25, 26. Is. 44.3.4. Heb. 11.28. Gal. 4, 5.6</note> God doth as it were promise and assure the Baptised, that if he will be teachable and tractable to the means that he shall afford him, he will pour a measure of his grace and spirit upon him, that shall work that in him, which he requires of him and be an Inward pledg and seal of his Adoption, and that he will wash away the guilt of former sins <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16.</p>
                           <p>By the persons (or Churches, or guardians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose power the Baptised is) profession of the true faith as it is now compleated since Christs resurrection, and submitting to the plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and washing with water, Baptism becomes a professing and obliging sign on the part of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50669:63"/> Baptised, to continue in the faith and to submit to the means of grace, and wait for a further por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spirit in ways of holy obedience.</p>
                           <p>So that water in Baptism is a means, which Christ hath chosen and ordained to transact a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant twixt God and all the Gospel Churches, whereby the persons Baptised, are separated from the world, dedicated to God, taken into a saved state, under great hopes and possibilities of eternal glory and salvation, and a portion in the resurrection of the just.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Here is a teaching after Baptism. Such a teaching as implies a great change for the better, both in the things to be taught and the teachers themselves, from what they were under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dispensation.</p>
                           <p>As after the Baptism of <hi>Noah,</hi> there was a more full Revelation of the mind of God, for reforming the exorbitances of mankind, before the flood: And after the Baptism in the red sea, a more large and full manifestation thereof by a new edition of laws in mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for reforming the corruptions crept in among the seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So now the Gentiles were to be adopted into the stock of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and the natural branches to be cut off by an eminent Judgment, it pleased the supream Head and Governour of his Church to bring forth his laws in a third and new edition,<note place="margin">Heb. 9, 10.</note> and lead his Church to the highest pitch of reformation until his second coming.</p>
                           <pb n="117" facs="tcp:50669:63"/>
                           <p>It was not our Lords design to destroy or alter the old standing way of Salvation by the gracious Covenant, nor the old standing rule of righteousness and equity: but so to order and alter things that the end of the gracious covenant and rule of righteousness might the better be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and accomplished.</p>
                           <p>Our blessed Saviour being Anointed, and seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this work by a voice from Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him,</hi> did both in his life time,<note place="margin">Act. 1.3. Lu. 24.45. Joh. 15.15 26. Gal. 15.16 2 Cor. 12.4. Act. 26.16 1 Cor. 9.1.</note> and after his Resurrection declare to his Apostles, all those explications and alterations of the former Doctrine, Laws, and Government of the Church, which he saw needful. And after his Ascending into Heaven did bring all things to their remembrance with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and evidence. And to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was not conversant with him in his life time, nor a witness of his Resurrection. He revealed all things by divine vision, as a singular priviledge.</p>
                           <p>Therefore to understand what Christ hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or abrogated, and what he hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be observed, we must have recourse to the records of the story of Christ himself and of the Preachings, Actings and Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to the first planted Churches, who received of the Lord what they delivered to them, which records together with a spirit of Prophesie for understanding of them, have been by a gracious and wonderful providence preserved, and by a faithful tradition of a godly remnant in all ages, derived down to us, through all the opposition and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50669:64"/> corruption of intermediate times, as the Book of the Law, was to the Church of the Jews: And besides what is there required nothing ought to be imposed as necessary to the spiritual state of a Christian.</p>
                           <p>In particular among other things, it appears it was the mind of Christ.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>As to Ceremonials.</hi> That whatsoever in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical government did hinder the Communion, or was a partition-wall twixt Jew and Gentile should have an end. Also whatsoever did signifie that Christ was not come in the flesh, was not dead (whereby an atonement was made for sin) nor risen again (whereby the spirit was given to the Gentiles) all such things should cease, and be altered into some other Ordinances, that may hold forth Christ exhibited. To which end he ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Spirit, the Water and the Blood; or in common phrase, The preaching the Word of the Gospel, and use of both the Sacraments should be standing Ordinances or witnesses, that Christ was come in the flesh. Because all those three in the right ministration of them, have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus. But Circumcision and the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and the Priestly Ministry pertaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as signifying the <hi>Messias</hi> was not yet come, must now cease.</p>

                              <hi>As to Morals.</hi> That the righteousness of the Moral Law should be observed in the most spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner by all Christs Disciples,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.4. 2 Tim. 1.13.</note> Faith and Love being the sum of the Moral Law under the

And observing those ways and outward means of communion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, which the Son hath dictated to his Church since the taking away of the old Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and that in such a manner, method and order, that the Name of God in Divine Worship be not taken in vain.</p>
                           <p>And the duty of love to man,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.34.</note> Christ hath exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an higher pitch than before, not only to love our neighbours as our selves, but to love our enemies,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.7, 8.</note> yea to love one another as he hath loved us and given himself for us. So that love ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a new motive, a new example and a pressing command from Christ himself, seems as it were a new Commandment. Thus the Law of Faith as a demonstration of our entire love to God, and the way of his true worship;<note place="margin">Mat. 5.17.</note> and the law of love to man are the Morals of the Gospel, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that Christ came not to destroy the Law but to fulfil it,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.31.</note> and that Faith makes not the Law void but establisheth it.</p>

                              <hi>As to Judicials.</hi> That Laws with Penalties for restraining the overflowing of mans sin, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the disobedient for the benefit of humane society should be constituted among the nations, as agreeable and not contradictory to the Gospel, which is asserted by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10, 11.</p>

There's no command of Christ that it should be altered or abrogated upon their receiving of him: For this way of Churchood was inherent in the gracious standing covenant from the beginning. And the Jews that did believe were not by Faith first cast out of the Covenant, &amp; then received into a new,<note place="margin">Act. 2.37, 38.</note> by Baptism; but Baptism continued them in the gracious Covenant, under a new dispensation, from whence the unbelieving Jews were indeed cut off.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.17, 19.</note> Their rejecting of Christ being an high breach of the Covenant of Church-hood. And therefore the Gentiles who believe, do not come in on a new Church-estate,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.6.</note> but are grafted into that Church-estate from whence the unbelieving Jews are cut off, and are Proselyted into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Covenant, they and their seed being now the children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And so God is not the God of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.19, 20.</note>

                              <hi>The end of Baptism is to save.</hi> Baptism is a means of salvation in all the three editions of it.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50669:65"/> as a flood of vengeance on the body of the nation: And the believing Gentiles with their families were by Baptism saved from the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that lay upon their forefathers, of being out of the Church of God, and made capable of being saved from the wrath to come.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Baptism saves,</hi> in respect of the outward form and ministerial work. It saves with a temporary salvation. As the ministry is said to save,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.16.</note> because of the means and possibilities. But in respect of the power and internal efficacy when the fire is added to the water.

                              <hi>Baptism saves us,</hi> in a particular and personal way (If we be adult and grown up in the Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal education) by the answer of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward God and conformity to Christs death and Resurrection: But if Infants and in Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then in a general way of Gods Covenant with the faithful and their seed, whereby God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to call himself our God.

                           <p>How Baptism saves us is declared by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>

                           <p>From this whole History we may collect a <hi>three-fold Character.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>First,</hi> here is the Character of the true Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Catholick, and Apostolick Religion,<note place="margin">Eph, 4.4, 5, 6.</note> epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by S. <hi>Paul</hi> under seven heads.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. One God, and Father of all who is above all, and in us all.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. One Lord, the seed of the woman, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> the man Christ Jesus, by whom, and for whom are all things, the Mediator twixt God and man, the reconciler of all things, the head and Lawgiver of the Church, and Bishop of souls.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. One Faith, receiving the promised seed with subjection to his Laws, denying confidence in the first <hi>Adam.</hi> This hath been the nature of Faith more implicitly or explicitly from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="126" facs="tcp:50669:68"/>4. One Baptism, which under all the three editions thereof hath signified a profession and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to one God, one Mediator, and one Faith.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. One Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, forming a Ministry for teaching the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptised, and fitting them to enjoy Communion with the Father and the Son, and to love one another.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. One Body, whereof all the Baptised are professed members, and whereto they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly united by that one Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. One hope of their calling, namely Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body and eternal Life, sometime more darkly, sometime more clearly revealed and promised.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is the Character of the proper work of the Minister and Messenger of Christ.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. To engage all he can to be Christs Disciples, by transacting a Covenant with them for him by water.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. To teach the Baptised all the Commands of Christ and the observance of them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To kindle a fire in their bosoms by pressing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to the power of Regeneration, from the consideration of their profession and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in Baptism with water, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle S. <hi>Paul</hi> oft,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.11</note> Reckon your selves dead to sin and alive to God, yield your selves to God as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50669:68"/> those that are alive from the dead.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.13 1 Cor. 6.11. Gal. 3.27. Eph 4.17, 20. Col. 3.1, 3, 5, 9. Heb. 3.14. 1 Pet. 2, 1, 3, 21. 2 Pet. 1.9.</note> Such were some of you, but ye are washed, &amp;c. He that is baptised into Christ hath put on Christ. Walk not as other Gentiles, ye have not so learned Christ, ye are dead, ye are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen with Christ, therefore mortifie your earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly members, ye have put off the old man with his lusts, therefore lie not one to another. We are made partaker of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end. And <hi>Peter</hi> also when he exhorts, As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the Word. And declares that the salvation in Baptism is not from the washing of water but the answer of a good conscience. And that, that Christian, that is not diligent to add to his Faith virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity, &amp;c. hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that he was purged from his old sins. All which argumentations are taken from the form to the power, from the profession to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, from the water to the fire in Baptism.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is the Character of a sound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, a Disciple indeed. He is such an one as being moved with fear and reverence enters into the Ark for the saving himself and his houshold, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> One that is willing to be instructed, and desires to understand his Baptismal engagement. One that contents not himself with the washing with water, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form, but labours for the answer of a good conscience before God.</p>
                           <pb n="128" facs="tcp:50669:69"/>
                           <p>And though there are many <hi>Cains, Chams, Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels,</hi> and <hi>Judasses</hi> that are wash'd with water, who look at the water in opposition to the fire, and endeavour to quench the power of Godliness, yet he holds on his way, and looks at the water as weak and imperfect without the fire, and is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed nor discouraged.</p>
                           <p>He is one that tries all controversies by his Baptismal Faith, and all engagements by his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptismal Covenant.</p>
                           <p>He is one that loves the Ministery that teaches the commands of Christ, and watches over him to help him to observe them.</p>
                           <p>He is one that takes comfort in the promise of Christ <hi>(He that believes and is baptised shall be saved)</hi> to the assurance of Eternal salvation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can reason thus:</p>
                           <p>He that believes and is Baptised, or Born again, not only of water but of the spirit of holiness; not only by washing of water but also by the answer of a good conscience before God, shall be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eternally saved.</p>
                           <p>I believe and am baptised not only with water, but also with the spirit of holiness, which I find by the answering of my conscience before God, being able to appeal to God who knows the heart touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my truth and sincerity. Therefore I shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and eternally be saved.</p>

                  <p>BE pleased to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the first place, That the Reason of the Title <hi>Baptismus Redivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi> is from the earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to revive on all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the sence of their Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Covenant: Secondly that this discourse is not a narrow Text enlarged, but a large Text contracted with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reduce many Truths to their proper seat which in
<pb facs="tcp:50669:72"/> Reading may not so easily be discerned by a galloping Eye as by one that goes but a foot pace: Thirdly, That these Meditations were not calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for those that lie under the highest Elevations of the Artick and Antartick Poles, but for such only as live in view of the Aequator. The design is not to widen differences, but to close the breaches. If Christians would embrace one another in things clearly contained in Christs commission and bear one with another in things for which he hath not clearly given his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, the Sun would no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er go down upon their wrath,
<pb facs="tcp:50669:72"/> which is so parching and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, and would soon Arise with healing dews and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gleams of light and love to an happy Day. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of which design, This is an Assay, and but an Assay, hoping that some more able Pen will more throughly beat out the precious Wheat bound up in this Sheaff, which being scattered with an even hand, may by the Blessing of God bring forth the Harvest of that happy day which every one that loves the Lord Jesus in sincerity, breathes after, and longs for. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">John 17.4.</note>The <hi>Work</hi> of Reconciliation was finish'd in his death. The <hi>Ministry of Reconciliation</hi> began after his Resurrection. And in that space of time during His abode upon Earth before His Ascending to His Fathers right Hand, He spake to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples touching the Kingdom of God: The Word was not now, as it was before His sufferings, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> But that it <hi>was now come,</hi> and the Door now to be opened for all Nations to enter in: Neither was the Word that the triumphant Kingdom of Christ was come, namely that state of His Kingdom wherein he should restore the Kingdom to <hi>Israel,</hi> the Times, and Seasons, and the Mystery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Father thought fit not yet to reveal to His Church, only that there should be such a Day of refreshing in due time. But the Word was, that <hi>the Kingdom of Christs patience was come,</hi> namely, his Militant, Spiritual and Ministerial Kingdom for the gathering the first fruits of Jews and Gentiles in order to a fulness of both: For which end he Ordained the eleven Disciples, a representative Body of a Ministry to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, and such as were represented by them till Christs coming to make any other alterations in his Church.</p>
                  <p>Touching which Ministry the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Commission and Power given. And the execution of that Commission.</p>
                  <p>The story of the execution of this Commission begins after Christs Ascension with the giving of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50669:74"/> the Holy Ghost, who carried on the work in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the first Churches, the story whereof we have in the Acts and Epistles of the Apostles. And it is by the same power of the Holy Ghost that the same Church hath been propagated, and preserved in the true Faith in all succeeding ages.</p>
                  <p>The story of the Commission is that which is here chiefly intended to be considered, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by all four Evangelists.</p>
                  <p>In the History of Christs Resurrection it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that this was the great thing our Saviour minded as his proper work, and most upon his heart, in that juncture of time before his Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Heaven, namely, The settling a Ministry of Reconciliation: And therefore in all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable appearances to his Disciples, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were together, he was ever speaking of it: And all the Evangelists do record som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, and therefore it may be expedient to set down what every Evangelist says, and gather the substance of Christs Commission from them all. And then consider the sense of the words in a brief Analysis and literal Exposition. And sum up all in a brief Paraphrase, with Inferences from the whole.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s relation are first in time: They both relate what our Saviour said of this matter, (called the Kingdom of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3.) In the evening of the first day of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, when he shewed them his hands and his side, only <hi>Thomas</hi> being absent.</p>
                  <p>The relation of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates to a time, when they all met in a Mountain of <hi>Galilee</hi> by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50669:75"/> Christs appointment after the first day of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: And 'tis very probable that St. <hi>Marks</hi> relation is an Abridgement of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> or of the substance of the whole, not relating to any particular time.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>John</hi> doth further relate that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour said somthing to <hi>Peter,</hi> and about six more, at the Sea of <hi>Tiberias</hi> after dinner, touching the Ministerial charge.</p>

                     <p>All Power is given me in Heaven and in Earth.</p>
                     <p>To do the will of God for the Reconciliation and Salvation of Man. A fulness of Power was necessary to be exercised in Heaven and Earth to prevail with God and with Man. A power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, and a power to ascend, a power of the greatest Prophet, of the highest Priest and most powerful King. A power over Sin, Satan, the Law, the seed of the Serpent, Hell and Death.</p>
                     <p>This power was to be exercised in the nature of man, not by the power of humane nature, but by the power of God, in man and by man.</p>
                     <p>Therefore our Saviour, knowing the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power that was requisite to carry on the work of Reconciliation in perswading man to be reconciled to God, which would not be without power from above, and that could not be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted until he presented himself at the Fathers right hand, giving an account of the doing his will here on Earth: Doth now assert his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he hath from the Father to carry on this work to perfection.</p>
                     <p>Christ acts in this power before his sufferings, <hi>John</hi> 13.3. Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; he rose from Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now after his Resurrection this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50669:78"/> Power is signally declared and manifested, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. He was declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the Resurrection from the Dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All power</hi> signifies not onely power of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to act lawfully, which the word <hi>Exousia</hi> oft signifies, but also Power of ability to effect what he is called to, signified oft by the word <hi>Dunamis, Rom.</hi> 1.4. and is never separated from a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Call.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers good will and pleasure is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all the power given to Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All Power is given me.</hi> The Sum is, The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Counsel of his own Will hath given Authority &amp; fulness of Power to Christ as man, but not in the power of the manhood to transact the business of our Salvation. First, with God by a sacrifice of expiation, then with man by a Ministery of Reconciliation, and for that end to Descend and Ascend, and send forth his Holy Spirit, and hath promised to be with him, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things in a subserviency to his Kingdom and subduing all his enenemies that rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26, 27. <hi>John</hi> 8.29. <hi>Ps.</hi> 110.1.</p>
                     <q>As my Father sent me, even so send I you.</q>
                     <p>Our Saviour in his Prayer before his death by way of preparing his Disciples to this great work, testified in this manner, <hi>John</hi> 17.8. I have given them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. And <hi>v.</hi> 18. As thou hast sent me into the world, so have I sent them into the world.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50669:78"/>
                     <p>These words therefore imply two things chiefly. First, Christs faithfulness, That he doth pursue the Commission he received from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to execute his Divine Intentions, and gives forth his Commission accordingly. Secondly that there is a great likeness in the Fathers sending Him, and His sending them. Namely in such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as these.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As the Father sent Christ by several steps and preparatory works: So Christ sent his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, both before his death, as <hi>John</hi> 15.16. I I have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit; and after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, as in this place. And most fully after his Ascension by the actual giving the Holy Ghost, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Chapt.</hi> compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 26.17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As the Father sent Christ to begin the work of Reconciliation in mans nature by the sacrifice of himself: So Christ sent them to finish the work of Reconciliation in the persons of men by the Power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As the Father sent Christ, not with a bare authority, but such as had a sufficiency of Power attending it to effectual things according to that Authority. So Christ sends his Apostles and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes them with Abilities answerable to their work.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As the Father sent Christ as the root of the Vine of the Ministry, teaching Him his whole mind, to the end he might teach his Disciples, as His Sons and Scholars, the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God: So Christ sends his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles as twelve branches to propagate the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50669:79"/> of Christ. First by a miraculous way of Laying on of hands, then by an ordinary way of prophetical Schools, that there might be a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Sons of the Prophets as the seed of Christ the great Prophet, to all generations.</p>
                     <p>The words <hi>Ye</hi> and <hi>You</hi> in this Commission are not to be taken in a single sense only, but in a Collective and Comprehensive sense, not only for these single Apostles but for such as were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by them, and were virtually in them, which were not their natural seed, nor their civil seed, as such (by which are meant such as succeed in their outward places by a certain humane title and right, for they that do so are not <hi>eo nomine</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the Apostles) but their spiritual seed, who having attained alike Apostolical and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial spirit, have a door of providence opened by Christ in a lawful way to enter on the work. Such a son and successor was <hi>Timothy</hi> to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1.2.</p>
                     <p>The Representative sense may be cleared by these Reasons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because the promise of the Gofpel-Ministry in the Old Testament is made to a succession of some of the Prophets, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. This is my Covenant with them, saith the Lord. My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed from henceforth and for ever.</p>
                     <p>Nor when Christ gives a Commission for the Gospel-Ministry, He intends to fulfil the promise for it. Therefore he intends the successive Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50669:79"/> to be comprehended in the eleven to whom he spake.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As the Father sent Christ, so he sends the Eleven, But the Father sent Christ Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, as the root of the Ministry in whom the Branches are virtually. Therefore Christ sends them as principall Branches, in whom the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding branches were comprehended, <hi>John</hi> 15.1.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our blessed Saviour, saith <hi>John</hi> 15.16. I have chosen and Ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: what should that mean but that they should bring forth another Ministry to serve the next generation when they are gone.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Our Saviour promises to be with them to the end of the world: Therefore in them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Ministry, who are to teach the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples all things Christ hath commanded to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This was spoken to the Eleven, in whom the Twelve were Represented by the Apostles Interpretation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5. Whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the number of Twelve being intended in the Eleven, it was intended a compleat repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative number; as Twelve Patriarchs, in whom the whole Ministerial Seed was virtually comprehended.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As the twelve Apostles, were represented in <hi>Peter, Mat</hi> 16.15, 16. Whom say ye that I am. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter</hi> answered— So the succeeding Ministry was represented in <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. I charge thee before God, &amp;c. Preach the Word, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tius.</hi> 6.13, 14. I charge thee in the sight of God, &amp;c. Keep this Commandment without
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50669:80"/> spot, unrebukeable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>Go ye therefore into all the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Go ye,</hi> This implies the inward call to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Office. Christ says Go, to them whom he had prepared by instructing to the Kingdom, and had chosen and approved by several trials: In like manner to those who should immediately, and miraculously be fitted by the Apostles laying on their Hands (a way peculiar to the Apostles at the first issuing forth of the Gospel) he saith Go, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 15, 16, 17. And to those who should be taught, and fitted by these Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical men, on whom the Apostles laid their Hands, he saith Go, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2, The things thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, commit thou to faithful men, who may be able to teach others also, and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9. A Bishop must hold fast the faithful word or word of Faith, as he hath been taught: And so there is an inward Call to the Ministry by being taught, fitted, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and approved by those that are Fathers in the Ministry to the end of ages: So that Laying on of Hands after the Apostles time was not an actual conferring of the Ministerial gifts of Tongues and Prophesie, where there was none before; but a sign of Approbation of a gift received from Christ by his blessing on a Godly Education, whereby the gifts of Tongues and Prophecy with other sanctifying graces have been by degrees at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. In the first Churches there was first Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, and then a Ministerial Gift: But in the continuance of the Church, There was first a Ministerial Gift, then Laying on of hands as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50669:80"/> will appear by, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. compared.</p>
                     <p>The inward Call to the Ministry therefore doth not consist only, or chiefly in a willing desire, or strong impulse of Spirit to the work: but in being taught, fitted, approved, or chosen in the judgment of spiritual men, whereby a man may be perswaded that Christ says to him Go, though he is under some fears and unwillingness of Spirit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Go ye therefore.</hi> To those that are fitted for the work, this is the word of command, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement: Go and fear not: Have not I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? Have not I sent you?</p>
                     <p>Those whom Christ sends do oft need encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against their fears, when those whom he sends not, run with boldness. But our Lord bids them not Run but Go, Implying that it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to put on the work in Gods own pace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Go into the world:</hi> This implies a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Call in the exercise of the Ministry both when it was in the Ambulatory way, and should be in the fixed way: For it was not intended that they should go altogether into every place, but that they should by orderly consent disperse themselves: And that they should Go to this or that place, as some providence of God should lead them, as we see in St. <hi>Peters</hi> going to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Act,</hi> 10. And when they were persecuted in one place, they went to another. Sometime they were directed by a vision, and had a Call to one place more than another. And we read of of a door open, and a door shut, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50669:81"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Go into all the World:</hi> This doth not imply a duty in respect of the persons of the Apostles, as if it were a sin if they did not go all the World over, But it implies,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Liberty to the Gentiles as they should be called, the Restraint being taken off which our Saviour put upon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. Go not into the way of the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It implies a Command to lay such a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Gospel Ministry that thereby the Chuch might be preserved, and the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to all Nations: And thus their words went forth to the ends of the Earth, when they were personally dead.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This may imply a Prophesie of the success of the Gospel, that in process of time it shall leaven the whole world, and make it a new lump, as it is intimated in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.33.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>He breathed upon them, and said,</l>
                        <l>Receive the Holy Ghost.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>These words are the solemn conveyance of the Ministerial Office to the Apostles, the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Fathers of the Ministry: This is done by a sign and an explicatory word of the sign, by both which the Nature, Character, and power of the Gospel-Ministry is declared. This breath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of the Mouth, and from the Heart, and is sent forth with power and force: So our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our came into the World to make Atonement and Reconciliation in his own person, consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our nature unto God: And being to leave the World, and to go to the Father, and being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50669:81"/> become a Spiritual Christ, he ordains spiritual men to be his mouth to convey his holy Breath, his sacred Word of Peace to the sons of men, with force and power to melt their hearts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade their persons to be reconciled to God: which Breath of Christ comes from his very Heart, as a token of his dearest Love for them, for whom he breathed out his last in the Flesh, and was ready now to spend his best Breath for them at the Throne of Grace in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The Gospel Ministry then is nothing else but the Mouth of Christ Ascended into Heaven, whereby he conveys his Holy Breath, or Sacred Word (the mind of the Father) with power to the lost seed of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> to perswade them to come over to him the second <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this these Scriptures agree.</p>
                     <p>Psal. 68.11. <hi>The Lord gave the Word great was the army of them that published it, and</hi> v. 18. <hi>Thou hast Ascended on High, Thou hast led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50669:82"/> Spirit is a judicious discerning Breath, and a burning vigorous Breath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost:</hi> By this Explicatory word, Christ gives power to his Apostles to be his Mouth to breath forth the blessed Word of his Grace unto the World, and to breath forth their requests to the Father in his Name for the World, which is the Ministry of Reconciliation.</p>
                     <p>John 15.16. <hi>I have chosen and ordained you that you should Go, and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain. That whatsoever ye should ask the Father in my Name he may give it you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that the nature of the Gospel-Ministry is set forth by the Holy Ghost, or Holy Breath of Christ, and is thence called a spiritual Ministry or the Ministry of the Spirit: the preaching of the truth of the Gospel, being the proper means and instrument In and By which Christ Breaths upon the soul to enlighten, soften, quicken, encourage and comfort, and to beget a spirit of love and freedom to serve the Lord: whereas the Ministry of <hi>Moses</hi> which had not the Ministry of the Gospel promise joyned with it, is therefore called the Ministry of the letter (namely of the Law) only: And of death and condemnation: because it was no more than a moral perswasion to a heart, unbroken, unsoftned: and so did exasperate not subdue corruption, and left the soul to serve the Lord out of bondage fear, but infused not that love that it command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As the Gospel doth pouring the love of God into the soul.</p>
                     <p>John 1.17. <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50669:82"/>
                     <p>Hence the Gospel-Ministry, the Doctrine of Gospel is oft set forth by the Spirit or Breath of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Eph. 4.3, 4. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Doctrine of the Gospel. There is one Body and one Spirit, that is, one Doctrine, and one spiritual Ministry, which is as the soul to the body of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>By one Spirit we are all baptised into one body, that is by one Spiritual Ministry, and Doctrine believed: And we are all made to drink into one Spirit, that is into the Communion of one Doctrine of Faith Ministred to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Acts 20.28. <hi>Take heed to the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This holy Breath therefore is as the Internal Form, Essential Property and Character, by which Christs Ministry is constituted, known, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished: And it shews it self chiefly in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy, and a Spirit of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>1 Cor. 14.1. <hi>Court spiritual gifts, especially that ye may may prophesie,</hi> v. 15. <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, I will pray with the understanding also.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 Cor. 13.9. <hi>We know in part, we prophesie in part.</hi>

                     <p>Rom. 12.6. <hi>Having prophesie let us prophesie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of Faith.</hi>

                     <p>1 Pet. 4.11. <hi>If any speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The gift of prophesie, or preaching the Gospel is as a living Oracle in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Col. 1.3. <hi>We (the Apostolical Ministers) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thanks to God the Father of our Lord

                     </p>
                     <p>Behold, I send the Promise of the Father upon you.</p>
                     <p>These words in S. <hi>Luke</hi> are to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as receive the Holy Ghost in <hi>John.</hi> For they set forth the nature, character, and power of the Ministry to consist in the gifts of the Holy Ghost: only it leads us to distinguish 'twixt Christ brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on them on Earth, and his Breathing on them from the right hand of the Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. His Breathing on them on Earth did give them, <hi>Jus ad rem.</hi> And instructed them in the nature of their Office. He is Breathing on them from Heaven, is a giving them <hi>Jus in re,</hi> and an instructing them to the actual exercise of their Ministry which they were not to enter upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this Breath came upon them from Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Spirit of Power every way answerable to the exigency of the work.</p>
                     <p>The Promise of the Father.</p>
                     <p>The Promise of the Spirit is <hi>The Promise</hi> by way of excellency. The two great Promises were the Promise of the Revelation of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and the Promise of sending the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Promise of the Ministerial Spirit may be called the Promise of Promises.</p>
                     <p>First, because it virtually contains all the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the Gospel, as proper effects and fruits thereof. As Calling, Conversion, or the New-Birth: Also Adoption both of a people to Church-hood, (for the Ministerial gifts are a sign of Christs gracious Presence with a people, and choosing them to be his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50669:83"/>
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.) And also of a Person unto Sonship: For the Ministerial Spirit is a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Spirit from Glory in the Speaker to the Glory in the hearer, whose heart being changed into the image of the Word by the Power of the Spirit, and the Conscience bearing witness to it, the same Spirit doth bear witness of our Son-ship with one Spirit, as the Apostle, and teacher of us Gentiles hath taught us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.</p>
                     <p>This Promise also contains in it the Promise of Glorification, as it consists either in the first fruits of the Spirit, as Peace and Joy unspeakable and full of Glory: or in the Resurrection of the body, whereof the Spirit of Adoption is a sure pledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                     <p>Seondly, It is the Promise of Promises because it disposes us to perform the condition of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promises, Godliness hath the promise of this Life and the Life to come: Now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Spirit disposeth us to be Godly: For Christs sending forth the Ministerial Spirit is the cause or means that we come to believe, and so come to be capable of the Promise of a new-heart, and of the Spirit writing the Law in our hearts, and so becoming Godly, whereby we are capable of particular Promises.</p>

                        <hi>The Promise of the Father:</hi> Namely which he made first to me. For the Father is the Fountain, Christ the Cistern of the Spirit, the Apostles an Conduit-Pipes to diffuse this Water of Life. The Spirit is poured on Christ as the Holy Ointment on the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which ran down to the skirts of his garment. He is the first Anointed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50669:84"/> and then his fellows from him. They all of his fulness do receive, Ministerial, and Prophetical Grace like and answerable to that that is given to him. The true Character of which Spirit, both as it was in Christ, and is in all true Ministers is set down by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. <hi>God hath not given as the Spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Behold I send the Promise.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit proceeds from the Father, and the Son, but in the Order of the Divine Dispensation to us. It is from the Father to the Son, and by the Son to us. Here is the great Mystery of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of the Grace of God to Man: Man considered under a Covenant of works only, as a creature of God, God is only considered to him as his Creator, who doth justly require the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Law of his Creation: But man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as fallen and in misery, God is pleased to manifest himself to him as Father of Christ, in whom the nature of man is restored, and as send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fulness of his own Spirit to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the persons of men that receive Christ for renewing them also, and fitting them for Glory.</p>
                     <p>This order of the Promise of the Spirit to be given first to Christ, then from him to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and Apostolical Ministry and from thence to the World for gathering the Church, and to operate in all the members of the Church to form them to Christ. As the Soul operates in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, and the leaven to the leavening the whole lump: This I say will appear from these Scriptures.</p>

                     <p>2 Cor. 1.20. <hi>All the Promises of God in Him</hi> (that is in Christ) <hi>are yea, and in Him, Amen, to the glory of God by us.</hi> Here the order of the promises, to become Amen to Believers is from the Father, in or through Christ, by the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Ministry.</p>
                     <p>2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all</hi> (that is Apostles and Ministers of Christ, of whom he speaks) <hi>with open face, beholding as in a glass, the glory of the Lord are changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory as by the Spirit of the Lord</hi> (that is) As the Spirit coming from Christ to the Apostles made them glorious, and changed them into the likeness of Christ, beholding his Glory in the Gospel: So the Spirit comming from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50669:85"/> Ministry shining light to others, transforms them also, and makes them glorious.</p>
                     <p>And thus the excellency of the Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is set forth beyond that of <hi>Moses:</hi> who though he were transformed himself by being in the Mount with God and his face did shine, yet his Ministry was not the Ministry of the Spirit to transform others into the same image; because he was to cover his face with a vail of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: but the true Gospel-Ministry being with open face without a vail, proceeds from Glory in the teacher to Glory in the hearer:

                     </p>
                     <p>The Office of the Ministry is declared not only by the Internal nature, as the Soul and Life of it (namely the gifts of the Holy Ghost promised by the Father which denominates it a Spiritual and Prophetical Ministry) but also by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward exercises of it: which are first Preaching in order to the Baptising the first Christians who were to convey the Faith first given as a <hi>Depositum</hi> to their posterity, whereupon they were first to Preach, and then to engage them to the Faith by a professed Receiving it. The other work of their Ministry was teaching the Baptised (which S. <hi>Matthew</hi> expresly notes) in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and continuance of the Church, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the planting the Church hath Baptism to follow Preaching: but Preaching for the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church doth suppose Baptism going be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50669:86"/> as an engagement to learn the Faith, and continue that first received.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That this is the Order meant here, namely, Preach and Baptise in the Planting a Church: Baptise and Teach in the continuance of a Church Planted, may be thus further cleared.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because Christ promising his presence with his Church to the end of the world must needs imply a way, and a duty to continue it so long, and not that it shall be always in a gathering way. This continuance of the Church must needs be in the posterity and families of the first believers, who must be Baptised, that they may be taught Baptism in the continuance of the Church being an engagement to the teaching of the Ministry which Christ hath provided for the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> charge to Christian parents to bring up their Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, which is not only in their own, but under the Ministerial Teaching also, supposes them Baptised, or engaged to Christ and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, that they may be under the Admonition of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because this was Gods Order in the Old Church. <hi>Abraham</hi> beleived that he might be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised; But <hi>Isaae</hi> was uncircumcised that he might believe in the way of a Godly Education: Now that the New Church was so to be continued among the Gentiles is evident. For now was the time when that Promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was fulfilled. In thy Seed (Christ) shall all Nations be blessed as well as those of the Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And this Blessing was to be blessed with believing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50669:86"/> Gal.</hi> 3.8, 9. or with such like blessings as he was blessed with: Now one of <hi>Abrahams</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings was that the visible Church was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his seed, by a mark set upon them in Infancy engaging them to an Education under the legal Ministry: And that the case is alike in the Gospel Church, the Apostle intimates when he says, Is God the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gentiles also? yes! of the Gentiles also: But if God were not the God of the seed of the Gentiles in their generations keeping Covenant. And so engaging them to a godly Education in the Gospel-way by Baptism, He could not be said to be accounted the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Thus the first believers as so many <hi>Abrahams</hi> believed that they might be Baptised. The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding posterity are Baptised, that they might believe: Christ having provided a Ministry to teach after Baptism, as well as before.</p>
                     <p>In these two works Preaching in order to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, and teaching the Baptised, educating them in the Faith, is the sum of the Ministerial Work, to which all things else may be reduced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus much of Christ-Institution of the Ministry in the power to send: Persons sent, and nature of the Office transferred upon them: It follows in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalysis to consider Christs Directions in the exercise of their Ministry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First, what they should Preach to the World to be believed in Order to Baptism.</hi>

                        <hi>The Gospel to be Preached to all Nations was chiefly under two heads.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note>First, That the Promise of sending the Messias for Expiation of sin, and bringing in Everlasting Righteousness was fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That God doth now make a Promise for Christs sake to all the world of Mankind. That he will give Remission of sins past, and the gift of his Spirit to all those Persons, Families and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who shall believe and repent, and testifie this by being Baptised into the Name of the Father, who hath sent his Son, and the Son who hath done the will of the Father and is Ascended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of the Holy Ghost whom Christ hath sent from the Father: whereby he will become their God, and the God of their children in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations keeping Covenant.</p>
                     <p>This appears by these Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Isa. 40.9, 10, 11. <hi>O Zion that bringeth good tidings— Lift up thy voice with strength, lift it up, be not afraid: Say unto the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>Behold your God, Behold the Lord God will come, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Isa. 52.7. <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto</hi> Zion <hi>thy God reigneth.

                     <p>And it is further explained by going it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in another form of words, <hi>verse</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Break

                     </p>
                     <p>Here the first Word of the Gospel is. Behold your God.

                        <hi>This is also confirmed by the first Sermons of S.</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>to the Jews in Order to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> in his first Sermon to the Jews preaches first that Christ is the Messias and convinces them of his Death and Resurrection: Then he declares the Promise of Remission of Sins, and the gift of

                     <p>This being the Word of Gospel to the Jews, that they and their children should continue to be the Church of God if they received Christ and became his Disciples by submitting to his Baptism: the same word was preached also to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>

                        <hi>Every Creature:</hi> There is a Gospel for every Creature of mandkind: For the Infant, and young Children, as well as for the Adult and aged: The glad tidings for the young ones, is, That their Parents or Guardians in whose power they are being Converted to the Faith, have the old sins of the forefather forgiven them and are become as sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> to derive a blessing to their posterity, The blessing of a Godly Education, under the Law of grace, in the dispensation whereof God hath promised to give his Spirit, the great blessing of the Gospel for the giving a new heart and a new Spirit to make them heirs of glory: upon which account, namely, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of forefathers sin, and their being under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the spirit they are to be Baptised, with their Parents, or Guardians, on assurance of their Education in the faith. For who can forbid water to them that are under the promise of forgiveness of sins, and the gift of the holy Ghosts. Hence the word was Preached to the Goaler and all in his house. What word was that! <hi>but an Exhortation to be Baptised,</hi> which was <hi>Peters</hi> word <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Ʋpon which they that gladly recieved the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were Baptized.</hi> So the Goaler and all his glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50669:90"/> receiving this word was Baptized, and all His, of what age or sex soever they were, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, so they were His.</p>
                     <p>Moreover every Creature signifies not only every man and woman singly but cheifly as they are collective in Societies: for every Society of men in family or national relation is called an Humane Creature, or Creature of mankind, 1 Pet. 2.13. Which implies that Such an humane Creature may be converted to God? which establishes the power and authority of superiors in acting for God as the soul of this Creature, orderly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding inferiours to do nothing against the Truth but for the Truth: Like as in a single Believer <hi>the Converted will</hi> doth rationally govern the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man to yield its members weapons of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness unto holiness.</p>
                     <p>He that believeth and is Baptized.</p>
                     <p>This word <hi>He</hi> is to be taken not only for a single person, but also in a political, Collective and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive sence, for <hi>He</hi> and all his. As will further appear o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> these Considerations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This word must Correspond with the word Nations and Creature. That the word Creature comprehends a society as well as a single person hath been already asserted. And all nations, and All families of the earth to be blessed in Christ, the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are expressions in the Scripture of equall Import. Seing then the word <hi>He</hi> relates to Creature and nations, it must needs be taken in a Comprehensive sence also, and is as much as to say Whatsoever person, family or society of men believes and is Baptized.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'Tis reasonable to conceive That the holy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50669:90"/> Ghost speaking Comprehensively in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he speaks of the Church state in the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> may be understood as so speaking, when he speaks of the Church estate of the seed of the Gentiles in the new Testament. Now in the old Testament he thus speaks as comprehending the children in the parents, the governed in the governors.</p>
                     <p>Ezek. 16.6. <hi>I said unto Thee in thy blood live, looking at Israel as one man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hos. 12.4. <hi>He</hi> (the Angel) <hi>met him</hi> (Jacob) <hi>in Bethel, and there he spake with us</hi> (the Posterity virtually in him)</p>
                     <p>Josh. 24.15. <hi>I and mine house, we will serve the Lord, The house made Profession by the head of the Family.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou in the Commandments comprehends the Son and Daughter, the man and maid-servant or whosoever else is in a mans power, as is explained in the fourth Commandment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This exposition agrees to prophesies in the Old Testament concerning the New.</p>
                     <p>Psal. 22.36. <hi>A seed shall serve Him</hi> (the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias) <hi>It shall be Counted to the Lord for a generation</hi> (that is) <hi>When the seed of</hi> Jacob <hi>shall be cut off, Another generation of men shall serve him, that shall be Adopted in their rooms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Isa. 55.5. <hi>Behold thou shalt call a Nation thou knewest not, and nations that knew not thee, shall run unto thee. This is spoken to Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Isaiah. 49.22. <hi>Behold I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people, and they shall bring thy Sons in their Armes, and thy Daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders: That
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50669:91"/> is: They shall bring themselves and their Children, as the Children of the Church to the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. 'Tis reasonable to think that the Apostles preaching and practice was according to the sence of the Commission: Now they preacht, Thou shalt be saved and All thy house: And Baptized the Goaler and all His, Therefore in the word He, is Comprehended his House or All his.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As in the old Testament, If a stranger was said to be circumcised: It was understood that all his were circumcised, the Females in him, he males with him: And if his males were not circumcised, He was not said to be cercumcised as is evident Exod. 12.48. So in the New Testament where <hi>Paul</hi> says, he Baptized none but <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Gaius</hi> and the Houshold of <hi>Stephanus</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2.4.16. And besides he knew not that he Baptized any other. It is evident in <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Gaius</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the houshold from <hi>Act.</hi> 16.8. and under the houshold he comprehends the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour: And that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was chiefly founded in Beleiveing Housholds.</p>
                     <p>He that Believeth and is Baptized shall be saved.</p>
                     <p>These words may be considered as a Direction and a promise: As a Direction they declare unto Apostolical Ministers, whom they shall account visible Members of the Church or take into the Ark, And so they sound full thus: Whosoever Beleives, and is Baptized with all His, shall be of the number of saved ones with all his, that is to say, visible Church Members: For they are said to be saved in scripture, who are under the means and Possibilities for it, and are in a way or state of Salvation Act. 11.14. Rom. 11.26. Rev. 21.24. And this is the Judgment of Charity the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50669:91"/> speaks of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.7. It is meet to think thus of you all (That were Baptized <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>Lidia</hi> and her Houshold, the Jaylor and all his) That he that hath begun this good work in you or among you (in Baptism, &amp;c.) will perform, or finish it and bring it to perfection. Thus Baptism is said to save us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. and the Ministry saves us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. And thus the Church are to account the Baptized, as the Baptized are to account themselves in their visible state Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, dead to sin, dedicated to God, under Remission of sin and Children of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to this Salvation is the damnation spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the next sentence to these words. He that believeth not (which is discerned by his refusing Christs Baptism) shall be condemned or judged to be no member of the Church visible, but in the state of unbelievers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He that believeth and is baptised:</hi> This is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible character of such as Christ would have repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among his saved ones, until they fall off from him: which if it be in power, will be a certain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of eternal salvation: For there are three degrees of salvation. A probable possibility, An assured hope and certainty, and an actual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The first is, a Christians beginning baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal estate: The second is, his attainment to a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht estate or the abundant entrance: The last is, after life or entrance into the Holy of Holies. This Character therefore is such as may in the visibility of it agree to some, who are not finally saved, as it fell out in <hi>Judas,</hi> and probably in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the better understanding this Character,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50669:92"/> Two Questions would be resolved. First where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Faith consists, which preceded Baptism, in the first believers. Secondly, how it was visibly signified, declared, and manifested to the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table judgement of the Apostolical Ministry: Both which must be resolved from the story of the first Baptisms of the Churches, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Doctrine immediately upon it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer</hi> to the first Question. This Faith did consist in an assent and consent. An assent to the present truth then preached. That Jesus was the Christ, and that he was risen from the dead, and that remission of sins was by him, and not by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> law, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.32, 33, 38, 39. This belief of a God and of the Old Testament and of a life to come, &amp;c. was supposed in the Jews. A consent and willingness to <hi>become presently Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> to repent and become new Creatures, or to accept the exhortation to be Baptised, which is all one, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. Supposing Baptism under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                     <p>This is that which the Apostle affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10. This (saith he) is the word of Faith which we preach: That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with his heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved. This hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Baptism as the first degree of Salvation, wherein there is the first transaction of it: For when <hi>Paul</hi> says to the Goaler, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. Believe in the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, and all thine house. It is evident by the sequel of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that in believing he implied a willingness to be Baptised, and to become Christs Disciple, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50669:92"/> that by being saved, he meant Baptised, as the first step and degree of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer</hi> to the second Question. This Faith was <hi>visibly signified,</hi> and charitably accepted by that which the Apostle calls Confession of the mouth, and a yielding themselves to be Baptised; which was not alike in all. For this was in some explicitly, in some implicitly signified, and by interpretation, when our Saviour asked his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.15, 16. whom they say that he was? <hi>Peter</hi> answers explicitly which is the answer of the rest implicitly by a silent consent <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> When the Jews were pricked in their hearts, and cried out, What shall we do: It is not be supposed to be the voice of all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, yet 'tis to be looked on as the sense of the multitude in general, and they are thereupon exhorted every one to be Baptised. When the Goaler cried out what should I do to be saved? The Apostle answers to him and to his house, knowing that all the house were amazed as well as he, and he spake the sense of them all.</p>
                     <p>When therefore a single person of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was Baptised, as the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> his confession was explicit; but when a multitude were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, it doth not appear that all their confessions were made by verbal explicit consent, but that a <hi>silent consent</hi> in some, with the explicit confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and consent of others, and the ready yielding themselves in all to be Baptised into the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, the sum whereof was exprest in the form of Baptising: And yielding themselves also to be washt unto newness of life, was charitably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for a sufficient confession in order to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50669:93"/> Baptising a multitude, or a family. And this is not obscurely intimated in those words, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. they that gladly received his word (namely of exhortation to be Baptised) were Baptised the same day to the number of 3000, which cannot well be conceived but under the notion of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and implicit confession. I mean a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion explicitly opened by some, to which the rest exprest consent, not all repeating their words.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, an implicit confession and consent is to be conceived two ways. First, by persons of understanding, who are sometime represented in one chief person to be the mouth of the rest, as a foreman of a Jury, who speaks the sense of all, so the Apostles were represented in <hi>Peter</hi> as the mouth of all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by persons not of ripe age for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, who are by a right and law in nature represented in their parents and Guardians, so as they are to choose and will for them in all ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things: And the will of the parent herein is the implicit will of the Child: Thus <hi>Joshua</hi> chuses the Lord for himself and all his,<note place="margin">Jos. 24, 15</note> even such as had not yet Understanding. And our Saviour interprets the bringing little Children to him by those in whose power they were,<note place="margin">Mat, 10.13.14.</note> to be the coming of the Children to him: And the little ones being with their parents <hi>Dut.</hi> 29. are said to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in renewing a Covenant, and when the Covenant is subscribed by those that had Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Nehe.</hi> 10. The younger sort under under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are understood to be obliged in them, that had understanding. In this sense the Jaylor believed, with all his, of what age soever: and the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50669:93"/> people of <hi>Samaria</hi> are thus said to Believe <hi>Philip</hi> preaching the things concerning the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Act. 8.12.</note> and were Baptized both men and women; old and young of both sexes. In some of these sences Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and were Baptized according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.5. One shall say I am the Lords, another shall call himself by the Name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> another shall subscribe with his hand to the Lord and sirname himself by the Name of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>4.</hi> How to Baptise. Teach Baptising.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>John</hi> Preacht the Baptism of Repentance: So the Apostles are to Preach the Baptism of Faith in Christ, risen from the dead. They are to teach Baptizing, and to Baptise Preaching. They teach by word and sign, by the Word they Preach the Gospell generally, by the Water they apply the Gospell personally.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baptising into the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the form, or manner of Solemnizing Christian Baptism, which may be called a Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-washing. As it is Teaching, it declares the true Character of the Christian Religion: As it is wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it contains the transacting a Covenant by pure water twixt Christ and the Baptized. First here is the Character of the Christian Religion, as it is distinguished from all other Religions, Jews or Heathens: The Religion of <hi>Moses</hi> though it taught the true God and the true way of worship appointed by God for that season, yet it did not reveal the Father and the Son as the Gospel doth,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50669:94"/> That God is the Father of Christ now risen from the dead, and thereby declared to be the Son of God with power. Neither did it reveale the Spirit as proceeding from the Father and the Son now ascended into Heaven to the Fathers right hand: Neither was the Ministry of <hi>Moses</hi> (as <hi>Moses</hi>) the Ministry of the highest, most proper, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all work of Regeneration, Adoption and Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the first fruits of eternall life, as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Doctrine of the Father and the Son is, as it is said, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.1. He that Believeth that Jesus is the Son of God is born of God. And <hi>John</hi> 2.12. to them that recieved him, he gave power to be the Sons of God. Who are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. For grace and truth comes by Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>This distinguishes also the Christian Religion from all Heathen Religions, who have many Gods and many Lords and Mediators, and not Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and Comforting Spirits, but all in the power of mans fallen nature: But the Christian teacheth one God, and one mediator, and one Law of grace or of the Spirit to cooperate with him in all acts of Obedience, and Comfort him in all adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>Secondly as this is a washing-Teaching: It is the Acting a Covenant and Agreement by pure water.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. On the part of the Baptised. It is a willing yielding him, or themselves to be taught, and washt; with an implicit promise so to do under all the ways of Christs appointment</p>
                     <p n="2">2. On the part of Christ, acting by his Ministry
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50669:94"/> recieving the Baptised and washing them into the Name (or profession of the Religion) of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, It doth signifie a gracious acceptance and receiving into Christs Church as his school and temple, to be a scollar and a true worshipper, as a new Creature.</p>
                     <p>It doth also imply a promise on Christs part that the Baptised being under the Law of grace shall not be distitute of supply of his Spirit to coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with him for the perfecting these beginnings, if he continue to yield himself to God, as one that is alive from the dead.</p>
                     <p>That this Covenant transaction is signified by washing with pure water into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, will appear to any observing eye, in reading the sixth Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the Apostle argues from the Baptismal engagement, How by reason of Baptism they are planted together into Christ, and are under a law of grace: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having yielded themselves to God they should continue not to yield themselves to sin, in assurance the grace of God will not be wanting to them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. from the 1. to 15.</p>
                     <p>It will also appear by a serious weighing of the words of <hi>Peter</hi> in the nine first v. of the first Chap. of his second Epistle, The duty on the part of the Baptised is declared in those expressions. They have obtained like precious faith with the Apostle <hi>verse.</hi> 1. They are purged from their old sins. <hi>v.</hi> 9. They are to give all diligence to add to faith virtue &amp;c. to abound, that their calling may be sure.</p>
                     <p>The promise of Christ is <hi>v.</hi> 2. A multiplication
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50669:95"/> of Grace and Peace not simply, and absolutely, but in the knowledge, or rather acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) of God, and Jesus our Lord, which is the sum of the Apostolical Faith. Which acknowledgement is a continuance to own the Faith and adorn it with good works. In the doing whereof a multiplication of Grace and Peace is promised, for a promise is the ground of the Apostles prayer: And this Baptismal Covenant is the ground of all the Apostolical Benedictions &amp; exhortations in all the Epistles to the Churches. Looking at a Baptised people as a called people.</p>
                     <p>This form of Baptising is compendiously signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by being baptised into the Name of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.16. and 19.3. (that is) by Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tism to be taken into the profession of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which acknowledges Jesus to be Lord risen from the dead, and ascended into Heaven. By this expression Christs Baptism since he ascended into Heaven, is distinguished from the Baptism of <hi>John,</hi> who only Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in reference to Christ near at hand, and from the Baptism of spirituall gifts, which was given more immediately from Christ himself, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Baptism of Fire, which was given not t<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#uom" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>This relation is declared by the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Ye gave your selves first to the Lord, and then to us</hi> (the Apostles and Apostolical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry) <hi>by the will of God</hi> (signified in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Preach and Baptise)</p>
                     <p>By reason of this Covenant relations. The baptised have a name to live, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. And a visible Form of Godliness. As it was in the Old Church, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 16. I said unto thee in this blood live, and thereupon they had the Ornaments to be called a people of God, a chosen generation, a peculiar People, an holy Nation, and had the Oracles of God committed to them: In like manner the New Church of the Gospel by reason of Baptism have a worthy name and repute as of persons called with an holy calling, sanctified in Christ Jesus, a chosen generation, justified, sacred Saints. The Pillar of Truth considered with the Ministry of Christ amongst them, <hi>I say consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Ministry of Christ among them,</hi> which was the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and of Fire,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50669:96"/> and that which was as the soul to the body of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form, and as fire that added power and life to the materials of water Baptism; For Baptism of water alone, did not constitute them a Church under those worthy titles, but as under Christs ministerial gifts, which was a Testimony of Christs presence among them, and owning them to be his people. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.8, 14.</p>
                     <p>All this appears by these two places remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this purpose, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. In the first 'tis said, <hi>ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are justified, In the name of the Lord Jesus and by or in the spirit of our God:</hi> which words we may take either as referring to the Baptism of water only under the form of baptising in the name of the Father, Son and holy Spirit, for here is <hi>washing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit, and our God that is the Father:</hi> Or we may take the words as referring to the Baptism of Water and the Baptism of gifts. The Baptism of Water as compendiously exprest by these words, <hi>Washed in the name of the Lord Jesus.</hi> And the Baptism of Ministerial gifts as exprest in those words, <hi>In the Spirit of our God.</hi> In respect of both which the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was adorned with the name of a justified and sanctified people.</p>
                     <p>This last sence seems most probable as most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to that other place, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>According to his mercy he saved us by the washing of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly, &amp;c. through Jesus Christ our Saviour.</hi> Here Baptism of Water and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of gifts are joyned together, not as if all that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50669:96"/> were baptised with water, were baptised with Ministerial gifts: but because the gifts being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the good of all, and a special sign of Christs presence among the baptised. It is joyned with the Laver of Regeneration common to all, as compleating their visible Church-hood.</p>
                     <p>Yet Baptism with water hath the noble title of the washing of Regeneration: And hence it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all the baptised to account themselves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly, and engagedly dead to sin, and alive to God, <hi>Dead and risen with Christ, having put off the Old man, and put on the New, Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14 with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 9, 10. All which is spoken of the baptised, by reason of profession, engagement means of Grace, and the beginning state of Regeneration.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The last Direction is about ordering the Baptised. Teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you. Feed my Lambs, Feed my Sheep, Feed my Sheep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here our blessed Saviour instructs his Ministry, how his Church begun in believing families, should be preserved and continued to the end of the world, or till he come again: for so long as there is a Church, so long there must be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry which is known, not by a succession in the same chair (for a Wolf oft succeeds in the room of a true shepheard) but it is discerned by the spiritual gifts applied to do the work proper to the Ministry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In this Direction three things are chiefly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50669:97"/>
                     <p>First, <hi>the Ministerial Duty, Teaching, Feeding.</hi> In both which expressions are implied continual Baptism, Catechising, familiar conference, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monizing, Ordering times and places, watching over them, and admonishing in the Lord, praying with them and for them. In a word, a Parental Government, for the Scholars of Christ are the children of Wisdom, and Wisdom is a natural Mother, and Nurse, not a Stepdame to them: When S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives a charge to the Elders of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> to feed the flock of Christ over which the Holy Ghost had made them Overseers: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but all the particulars fore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned are comprehended in feeding and over fight. And where a duty is commanded, all the necessary means and circumstances are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it by authority of that Divine precept. <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain:</hi> For by the Name of God is specially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended all those ways and means which he hath appointed for making known his will to us &amp; our enjoying communion with him according to his promise which are the subject of the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and particularised to the Jews in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Ʋnto the place which the Lord your God shall choose to put his Name there, unto his habitation thou shalt seek,</hi> &amp;c. Now the third Commandment requires that care be taken that nothing be done which may impair the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and due effect intended by God in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. As the Apostle expresses it in relation to the Gospel Ministry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, observe <hi>the persons to be taught.</hi> Then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50669:97"/> that is, the Baptised Nations, or Families which are described by their several degrees of growth in Grace: Some are Lambs, beginners, new born into the Church, but cannot go, nor suck without help, altogether ignorant. Some are Sheep of some growth, but weak, diseased, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring: Some of good liking, healtful, orderly and keeping fold. Christ hath committed to the care of his Ministers, not only the orderly grown Christian that is a man of experience: but the diseased also and unruly, yea the Ignorant that knows nothing: for when a Scholar is first entred, or an Apprentice first bound, it is supposed he knows nothing of the Trade. A Lamb therefore is one that hath Relation to Christ as a Disciple who must be taught <hi>ab initio</hi> to go and to suck, and must have only milk and not strong meat. This comprehends children in years, and children in knowledge, that must be taught to read, and to speak and to answer, and how to pray, &amp;c. as a means to a further growth:<note place="margin">Hos. 11.3.</note> Hence God says to the Old Church, <hi>He taught Israel to go,</hi> and our Saviour says to the Gospel-Church. <hi>Suffer little Children to come to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lambs are part of the Ministerial Charge, and therefore they must be Baptised, whereby they are Dedicated to Christ and his Ministry to be Educated in the Faith of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Thus is fulfilled the Prophesie touching Christs ruling his Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He shall feed his flock like a Shepherd, he shall gather the lambs with his arms, and carry them in his bosom</hi> (the way of Christs Education of little ones in Christs bosom) <hi>and shall gently lead them that are with young or give suck.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:50669:98"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Observe what the Baptised are to learn in Christs Schools. To observe all things I have commanded you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All things:</hi> Namely pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, or the State of the Gospel-Church, or the Name and Profession of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Which I have commanded:</hi> Not <hi>Moses, Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>So many as are Baptised into Christ have put on Christ to be their teacher, not</hi> Moses; <hi>For the Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Christ.</hi> Christ unvails <hi>Moses</hi> face, and casts off whatsoever pertained to the vail, and so makes all things new, because more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All things:</hi> Which he spake in his life time, and after his Resurrection whilst he was upon Earth: or more fully revealed after his Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.44. Either touching the Mistery of the Father, and the Son, <hi>John</hi> 16.25. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. Or the Mistery of the Churches Union with Christ, <hi>John</hi> 14.20. Or the duty of the Church to Christ, and all her fellow Members: what of <hi>Moses</hi> Law was to be abolished: what things of Moral Equity to be continued: what Ceremonies or outward ways of Worship to be used in stead of Circumcision, Passover, Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Feasts, Temple, Priesthood, &amp;c. So as yet the Church might be still the School of Wisdom, a Temple of Divine Worship, a City of Saints: what kind of a Government should be used in his Church, namely, Paternal and Fraternal, but not Magisterial, Lordly, or Tyrannical, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. What general Rules to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50669:98"/> in ordering particular and occasional circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances belonging, but not essential to Divine Worship, so as the Name of Christ be not taken in vain, &amp;c. Such like things as these summarily comprehended in Faith and Love, it appears by the Apostles writing and practice, were the commands of Christ to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I have commanded you:</hi> Christ revealed his whole mind touching his Church, first to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and committed it to them as a <hi>Depositum</hi> to be transmitted to posterity. As <hi>Moses</hi> received the pattern of all things in the Mount, but it was a vailed pattern. So the Apostles are in the Mount with Christ risen, and receive the unvailed pattern of heavenly things themselves. It was for the honour of the Apostles that Christ gave his commands first to them, and by them to his Church as his <hi>Internuntii,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> was of old: But it was also for their admonition to remember they were not Lords of the Church to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands at their own will, but to be faithful as <hi>Moses,</hi> of whom it was said, <hi>As the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded so did he.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This word of Christ committed as a <hi>Depositum</hi> to the Apostles, was by them faithfully delivered over to the first Churches by preaching and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. <hi>Be not troubled neither by spirit nor by word, nor by letter as from us</hi> (that is) <hi>we have neither written nor spoken such a Doctrine.</hi> Jude 3. <hi>Earnestly contend for the Faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first Churches delivered that word by preaching and suffering to the next ages, and with their preaching and suffering they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50669:99"/> the Records, That so the Oral Tradition of the Word might ever be tried by the Records, and so the truth preserved in the worst of times. As <hi>Moses</hi> left a Record of the whole Law to be kept, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>When</hi> Moses <hi>had made an end of writing the Law, he commanded the</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites <hi>saying, Take this Book of the Law, and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp;c.</hi> And this restored life in the Church, when the people had forgotten the Law as in <hi>Josiahs</hi> time, and so was a witness against them of their rebellions: Even so it is, and hath been in the Gospel-Church. This is the true Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Teach them to observe all things I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Baptism doth engage the baptised to keep all Christs command. They that reject Christs commands in effect deny their Baptism.</p>
                     <p>The Keeping is

                           <item>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Observation</hi> is in all manner of the conversation of the baptised. The baptised are preservers also or conservators of the truth of the Gospel by their gifts, authority, sufferings according to their places: They are not only <hi>Custodes utrius{que} tabulae,</hi> but <hi>Custodes Evangelii.</hi> Thus the Church is the keeper of the Oracles of God, and the pillar and ground of the truth. First in respect of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry who are peculiarly charged to keep the <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm,</hi> and to teach the baptised: Secondly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Baptism which engages the baptised to Christ and his Ministry.</p>
                     <p>Thus Christ hath fully provided for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50669:99"/> of his Truth, which was signified in the Old Church, where the Tabernacle (the figure of the Mistery of Christ) was pitched in the midst. The Priests next about the Tabernacle, and the body of the people next about them:<note place="margin">Num. 2</note> A double guard to preserve the Tabernacle. Thus it is in the Gospel-Church.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>He that believes and is baptised shall be saved.</l>
                        <l>Whose sins ye remit they are remitted.</l>
                        <l>Preach Repentance for Remission of Sins.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>These words have been considered as a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the exercises of their Ministry. To know both what is the true Character of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. He that believeth and is baptised with all his. As also in what esteem and repute to have them, namely as persons saved, and remitted, that is Ministerially brought into a state of Salvation, and under the means, hope, and great possibility thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It remains to consider these words as a promise, which leads to the third part of this Commission.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which our Saviour promises is both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Ministry and the Baptised.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To the Ministry, It is a promise to confirm in Heaven, what they do according to his will on earth, and is as much as to say, Whom ye wash they shall be washed, whom ye save they shall be saved, whom ye remit on supposition of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition performed, shall be remitted on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fromance of that condition.</p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50669:100"/>
                     <p>This was the time when our Saviour fulfilled his Promise to <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18, 19. I will give thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven, &amp;c. For now after his Resurrection this power is given to open a door by Baptism for all Nations to come into the Church, as a pardoned and renewed people, and to shut out whosoever reject the terms of Christs Baptism as a rejected people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt and condemnation of their own, and forefathers sin.</p>
                     <p>For if it be demanded what sin is Ministerially remitted in Baptism. The Answer seems to be this: That Baptism is a sign, signifying the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of sin past, and assuring it to them who do unfeigned betake themselves to Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. God hath set forth Christ a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness for Remission of sins that are <hi>Past,</hi> through the forbearance of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The sins that are past</hi> are either mens actual sins, or the forefathers sin, which is not only the transgression of our first Parents but of our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Parents. So the sins of the Apostate Gentiles in their defection at the tower of <hi>Babel</hi> did justly keep out the Posterity from being of the Church of God, and the sin of the Jews in Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and rejecting Christ doth justly keep out their children: which sin, is remitted both to Jew and Gentile in them that come in to Christ, and are baptised, and the door of mercy opened to them. This is plainly intimated in S. <hi>Peters</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to be baptised, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50669:100"/> with <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. So that not only that called Original, but that which may be called National sin of Apostate forefathers, is remitted, with the personal sins (if guilty in that respect), so as neither the one nor the other shall be any more a Bar to hinder the grace and mercy of God in the means by God provided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And for sins to come:</hi> Baptism is a sign signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and teaching, That there is a fountain open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for sin and for uncleanness, a fountain of blood, and a fountain of water: A fountain of blood to cleanse from the guilt of all sin upon unfeigned repentance and turning to God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. &amp; 2.1. <hi>v.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our sin, God is Just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. <hi>If any sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for all our sins,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. There is a sin unto death, I do not yet say, That ye shall pray for it. This is written to persons whose sins were before remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Baptism.</p>
                     <p>There is also a fountain of living water opened by the death of Christ, signified in Baptism, ready to flow forth as from a fountain unsealed, to sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the hard and stony heart to make the barren fruitful, to strengthen, stablish and comfort those who betake themselves to Christ and thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly desire it.</p>
                     <p>John 7.37. <hi>He that believes in me out of his belly shall flow Rivers of living Water,</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>Whosoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely,</hi> Rom. 8.2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus hath freed me from the Law of sin
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50669:101"/> and death,</hi> Lu. 11.13. <hi>How much more shall your heavenly Father give his spirit to them that ask him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus as Christ came personally by Water and Blood, so he comes Ministerially by Water and Blood to every one that believes, whereof Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is a teaching sign, and not only so, but also a seal assuring the comfort of the Water and Blood to every one whose conscience answers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right towards God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>In relation to the Baptised.</hi> Christ promises in these words, If they be sincere and with full purpose cleave to the Lord, he will do that for them which is peculiarly his work, so as they shall certainly be saved. They shall enjoy the power of that which is acted in the Ministerial Form: Namely</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The transacting the business of Remission of sin at the throne of grace, by the application of the blood of sprinkling for the quieting the Conscience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw neer with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience and our bodies washt with pure water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Adoption outwardly taught by sign to be inwardly sealed by a spirit of holiness, working a child-like disposition to God to call him father, and obey him as a father, of which work the Conscience bearing witness. This spirit of Holiness which the spirit of Christ, In us bears witness with the conscience by a certain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration and undeniable conclusion, That we are the Sons of God, and heirs of Glory <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. The spirit it self beareth witness with our spirit that we are the Sons of God, and if Sons, then heirs.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50669:101"/>3. The possession of the inheritance purchased in the first fruits of peace and joy; and then in the fulnhss at the Resurrection and Being in the place Christ hath prepared for his. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. <hi>We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the Beginning of our Confidence stedfast unto the end.</hi> This beginning of our Confidence is our profession in Baptism, which if we hold fast, Christ promises we shall be partakers of all that work which is peculiarly his in Regeneration, Remission, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Glorification.</p>
                     <p>This twofold work in Regeneration, (as it were two degrees) namely the Ministerial work, and Christ peculiar work seems to be intended by our Saviour <hi>John.</hi> 3.5. Except a man be borne of water and the spirit he cannot enter (that is fully and abundantly enter as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.) into the Kingdom of God. A man is born of water in the Ministerial work, and so Baptism is the Laver of Regeneration begun in the means and outward state of the Baptised: But unless the Birth of the spirit come to it (the work peculiar to Christ) the meerly Ministerial work will never perfect the new man, no more than the female can perfect a birth without the male, or a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mixt bodies of earth or water only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fire. And therefore our Saviour calls the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal birth meerly considered as the Ministry of water to be but flesh, weak, and cannot of it self attain salvation without the cooperation of Christ himself. That which is born of the flesh is but flesh, that which is borne of water is but water: Or, The Ministerial birth in Baptism meerly as so, signifies but the birth of a Christian in Repute,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50669:102"/> under means and possibilities, but carnal, as a babe weak as water, apt to fall away, and oft never comes to perfection: but when the work of Christ himself comes, who only hath power on the heart of man; then a spiritural man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly brought forth even to perfection.</p>
                     <p>This saying also of S. <hi>Peter</hi> confirms all this, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Baptism saves us:</hi> not (only) <hi>the washing of the filth of the flesh</hi> (which is the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal form) <hi>but the answer of a good conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by the Resurrection of Christ,</hi> or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, whereby he rose from the dead, which is the power of Baptism: And seems to be set forth by the day of Jesus Christ, <hi>Philem.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Behold I am with you always to the end of the world. Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To encourage the Ministry in the work of Planting and Watering, Gathering and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Church; and to encourage the baptised to keep the first Faith, unto which they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, and together with it to observe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Christ by the Apostles. Our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour makes this general promise, <hi>Behold I am with you always to the end of the world, Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the discovering the marrow of this great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, every word would be severally weighed. And it would be considered, How it is fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led notwithstanding the many withdrawings of Christ from his Church and Ministry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Behold:</hi> This precious promise is as a fountain sealed with two seals, The one at the beginning,

                        <hi>Behold,</hi> the other at the end, <hi>Amen. Behold</hi> seals the Excellency, <hi>Amen</hi> the Certainty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And Behold, or See.</hi> This is a word of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Admiration, and Direction.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Behold,</hi> and attend the Doctrine of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise containing the great Mistery of the Union of Christ with his Church: As the Father is in and with Christ by his Word: So Christ is in and with his Church by his Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Behold,</hi> and admire the Providence of Christ over his Church. A wonderful thing it is that the Ministery and Baptism of Christ should be preserved in all ages in the midst of such oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and corruptions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Behold,</hi> and see by Faith Christs presence with you in your greatest trials.</p>

                        <hi>I.</hi> In whom the nature of man is now raised and spiritualised, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. Though we have known Christ after the flesh under the legal types and shadows: <hi>yet henceforth know we him no more, after the flesh and a corporal presence,</hi> but as ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Father and a Mediator at his right hand, made Lord of all, and as having obtained the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be given to all that believe, Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</p>

                        <hi>I am:</hi> Christ is the same yesterday, to day, and for ever: <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was</hi> (he saith not I was, but) <hi>I am, John</hi> 8.58. He was <hi>I am</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> and the people of <hi>Israel, Exod.</hi> 3.12, 14. The same that he was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and the Old Church, the same he is to the Apostles, Apostolick Ministers and the baptised of the New Church, Jehovah blessed for ever: The strong God merciful and gracious, ready to

                     <p>
                        <hi>Witb you.</hi> Not in the presence of my humane nature, though now of natural made spiritual: For in respect thereof he goes away to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for his Church whither to receive them when he shall come again, and in the mean time the Heavens must receive him at the right hand of power. But he is with his Church, as the Sun is with us, when he rises in the Morning, though he is at a great distance from us, by his light and heat producing Reviving and Preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Sublunary things: And as the head is above the body, yet is present with the body by an Inseparable union, and an effectual influence, to govern, care for, and watch over the body. So Christ though he was with his Church in the old Testament yet it was as night with them: All things were in obscurity: But when he was risen and ascended,<note place="margin">Isa. 60.1.</note> now it was truly said to the Church, <hi>The glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.</hi> Christ now appears and is with his Church as the Rising Sun, shining more and more to the perfect day, and though sometime clouded yet never any more setting in obscure darkness. This our Sun and head is in our nature glorified in the Heavens, and is with his Church by an inseparable union, and a Constant efficacy, which appears specially in two things.</p>

Christ promises a Ministry to the Baptised, and gifts to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>
                     <p>That is also a promise to the Baptised, <hi>Isay.</hi> 54.13. All thy Children shall be taught of God, and great shall be the peace of thy Children: for the Church there that is spoken to is the Gospel Church to be gathered of Jew and Gentile, a fruit of the travel of Christs soul mentioned Chap. 53. The Children of this Church are the Baptised of all nations, to whom Christ is promised to be a Teacher, who is God blessed sor ever, and that not only in an immediate way, but also mediately by his Apostles &amp;c. by whose mouth he speaks, and in whose Ministry his spirit breaths, which being blest to the Baptised (the Children of the Church) doth settle a quiet and peaceable state in their souls and fills them with joy unspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>So that as our Saviour said of himself <hi>John</hi> 8.29. He that sent me is with me. The Father hath not left me alone, for I do always the thing that pleases him: So the true Ministers of Christ may say: He that hath sent me is with me Christ hath
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50669:104"/> not left me alone, neither will he whilst I do the things that please him.</p>
                     <p>And the baptised may likewise say: He that hath called me is with me, he will not leave me alone whilst I do the things that please him. He that hath begun the good work in mutual Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal engagements will perform it unto a day of perfection:<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.24. Ps. 84, 11.</note>

                        <hi>Fear not, for I am with thee, be not dismayed for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee by the right hand of my righteousness.</hi> In a word he is with them to teach and lead, to hear and help them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>He is with his Church by the Ministry of his Angels:</hi> For Christ being exalted to the right hand of power is become the head of all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and power. All the Angels worship him, ascend and descend upon him, are at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and sent forth by him for the good of them that fear God. Thus Christ is with his people oft times when they are not aware, ordering things for their comfort sweetly, and seasonably, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting evils, supplying necessities, bearing off the force of a falling stroke, delivering out of, and supporting under great Tentations. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture records how he was thus with <hi>Peter</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out of Prison by an Angel, who, or some other, was shortly after sent to <hi>Herod</hi> to smite him, who put him in Prison, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.6, 23.<note place="margin">Act. 12.6, 23.</note> Thus an Angel directed <hi>Philip</hi> to meet the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus Christ is with his Ministers and faithful people, by the influence of his own Spirit, and the Ministry of Angelical Spirits, whilst his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature is in Glory at the Fathers right hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>With you:</hi> By <hi>You</hi> is meant the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to whom he spake, as the first branches of the Vine of the Ministry, and in them their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful successors, as their sons and heirs and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical seed insisting in the steps of their Doctrine and Conversation.</p>
                     <p>1 John 4.6. <hi>We</hi> (the Apostles) <hi>are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth us, He that is of God hearth not us: hereby know we the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Error.</hi> And so the true successors of the Apostles succeeded as their scholars in the same truth received from them.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:50669:105"/>
                     <p>Phili. 3.17. <hi>Brethren be followers together of me, and mark them who walk so as ye have us for an Example</hi> (that is) <hi>Those Teachers who make us the Apostles the first Fathers in the Ministry as their pattern and Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 Tim. 2.12. <hi>Thou my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; that is, the Ministerial cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to succeed the Apostles as his son: And to continue this succession. He must commit the things he had learned of S.</hi> Paul <hi>to faithful men that might teach others for the Ministerial work, as their sons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the Baptised are the Children, Scholars, Disciples of the Apostles and Apostolical Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry: But such as are not only Baptised with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but also, with the Baptism of Spiritual gifts, whether more immediately or in the way of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly education, these are more peculiarly the Sons of the Apostles, as the Sons of the Prophets were of old.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>you</hi> in the promise is as large as the word <hi>ye</hi> in the Command, <hi>Go ye,</hi> which was shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before in a Comprehensive word.</p>
                     <p>As the word <hi>He</hi> in reference to the Baptised is Comprehensive and signifies a man in his politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call capacity for him and all his: So the word <hi>ye and you</hi> in reference to the Ministry, comprehend the Apostles, and all their legimate Sons, their propheticall seed.</p>
                     <p>That which may further illustrate and clear this, is the comparing of this beginning of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the new Testament with that solemn Beginning in the old with <hi>Abraham:</hi> Which hath so much the more force, because <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Representative Father to both Churches, not only
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50669:105"/> that of his own natural seed, but also of the seed of the Gentiles to be grafted into his stock, and counted to him for a generation, when the other should be cut off, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.27. <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.20.21.22. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. to 25. In which last place <hi>Thou and thee</hi> signifie the Families of the Gentiles adopted into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Church-estate instead of the Families of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>When the Lord took the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his visible Church, he founded their Church estate in the Covenant of circumcision, whereby they professed, and were engaged to keep the Law; and in the covenant of the priesthood cald the covenant of <hi>Levi,</hi> who was in the Loins of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the education of the circumcised in the Ordinances of the Law.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>two Covenants</hi> were made with the whole people of <hi>Israel</hi> being in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loins, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent believer, their representative father.</p>
                     <p>And the sum and substance of this covenant was exprest in a few significant words. I am God All-sufficient, walk before me, and be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
                     <p>In like manner: In the founding of the Gospel-Church: Our blessed Saviour, who is the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the beginning and the end, the first and the last (having as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented this whole Mistery in his own person by being first baptised with water, then with the Holy Ghost, in the power of which he went forth to the Ministerial work) founded the new Church of the seed of all Nations, <hi>In a Baptismal Covenant, and a Ministerial Covenant.</hi> The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal, to engage them to the Faith and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50669:106"/> of the Gospel: The Ministerial to educate them in the faith professed.</p>
                     <p>These two Covenants (in which consists the Church estate of the Gentiles) were compleated in transacting with the first Fathers of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and the first Baptised.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Baptised,</hi> because the Gospel-Faith is to be kept in the generations of the faithful, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the first believers, eminent professors of the faith first given.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Ministry</hi> being a product of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, or of Fire, is represented in the Apostles, who were the first baptised with the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>And lastly the sum of this Covenant or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants is declared briefly and significantly to the same purpose as that with <hi>Abraham, Teach them to observe all things I command you:</hi> what is that, but <hi>walk before me and be upright?</hi> And <hi>Behold I am with you:</hi> what is that, but <hi>I am God All-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am with you always:</hi> But doth not Christ oft withdraw his presence? <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.10. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled and vexed his holy Spirit, therefore he turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5.15. I will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.20. I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be, for they are a very froward generation, children in whom there is no faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ is with his Church in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Apostacies. He doth not so withdraw himself that he forgets to make good this word of his: For</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50669:106"/>1. He is present whilst he with draws his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, because he hath a merciful as well as a just end in those withdrawings, to be a means to bring them to acknowledge their offence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though he is not with his Church in their Apostatizing, yet he is with his Church under A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy, to set bounds to it, that it destroy not his Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Apostacy of the Church is <hi>from the power of Godliness, but never wholly from the form,</hi> or outward face and appearance of the truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Having the form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof.</hi> And as the power at the first planting the Church brings in the form, so the form in restoring the Church brings in the power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the Jewish Church,</hi> circumcision, and the priesthood which were the form or face of the Jewish Religion, with the Tables of the Law were preserved in greatest Apostacy and changes: Circumcision among the ten Tribes, as well as the two, and Priesthood among the two tribes: By virtue of which form there being both in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and Priesthood an engagement to the true God, and to his Law, there was now and then a reviving and recovery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the Christian Church.</hi> A form of Ministry and Baptism into the true faith with a profession to educate children of the Church in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Creed, Lords Prayer, and Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, with owning the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the Word of God, hath been preserved all along: And the Ministry that hath been continued in the Church,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50669:107"/> the <hi>Roman,</hi> and other Churches, was not like the Ministry <hi>Jeroboam</hi> set up which had no bottom at all of divine Institution, but was meerly <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi> invention: But rather it was like the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery and Preisthood at the temple, when the sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> ministred before the Idolls or worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Baal,</hi> as in the time of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Manasseh:</hi> For the Church of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es had a Ministery first planted by the Apostles and Apostolike men, the form and face whereof hath continued under many corruptions all along: Which corruptions could not make void, either the office and place of the Ministery, or invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the lawfull acts done by vertue of the office. This form of Godliness or the true Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never wholly apostated from, becomes a means by virtue of this promise to introduce and restore the power, as affording some bottom for Reformation to work upon.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Apostacy from the <hi>Power</hi> is only in a prevailing faction in the Church, not of the whole Body: Christ doth always preserve a Remnant according the election of Grace <hi>Isay.</hi> 10.21, 22. The Remnant shall returne— Though the number of Apostate <hi>Israel</hi> be as the sand of the Sea yet a Remnant shall returne — These are called the Holy seed: The heart of the oke which endures when the saplings rot: And a tenth reserved to God. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.13. In those is the life of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall spirit, and power of Baptism preserved. These are the two witnesses prephecying in sackcloth, who were in the form of the outward court, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ministry and Baptism but bore witness against the prophanations of the common worshippers,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50669:107"/> mixing the Heathen rites and manners with Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an forms, so denying the power both of Ministery and Baptism, which the two witnesses stood for all along, and at last prevailed and will prevail more and more.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Apostacy prevails not all at once, but comes on by degrees: In the beginning of Apostacy, Christ preserves his Church by such as overcome in the Churches and keep in their Communion; as may be seen by all the Epistles to the seven Churches of <hi>Asia:</hi> But when Apostacy is come to the height, so that Communion cannot be kept without partaking of their sin. Christ preserves his Church by a <hi>Separation from Communion,</hi> and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering into a new Communion, <hi>but so,</hi> That the Holy Remnant do carry the Holy vessels and preisthood with them out of Babylon, in their Return to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and are not to seeke to begin their Churchhood; I meane Ministery and Baptism are not lost in their spirituall Captivity by the overgrown sāction of the bastard and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Churchlings: As is also evident by the word of Christ reserving to such times. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. Come out of her my people, that ye communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate not with her sin. Where it is to be observed, First, that he determins her <hi>Communion sin.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that he calls them his people though they were in <hi>Babylon</hi> and therefore they have the Constitution of Churchood with them namely Baptism and Ministery, by the which they were engaged to Christ and enabled to proceed in the faith, having the sacred Scriptures among them: And thirdly, That he calls them to come out namely <hi>to himself, as having gone before them</hi> and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50669:108"/> removed his Glory and Presence from the tents of <hi>Babylon,</hi> once the Residence of his Beloved Spouse, now the seat of an obstinate and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent harlot.</p>

                        <hi>Always unto the end of the world:</hi> It might be more emphatically translated, All days, untill the consummation of this age; for the word <hi>Aioon</hi> here used, signifies the world in respect of its ages. As the word <hi>Oicoumene</hi> is translated World in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Inhabitants, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.1. And the word <hi>Cosmos</hi> is the world of the universe in respect of its beautifull frame, and the word <hi>This</hi> may be conceived to be understood to the word Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is else where added by way of distinction, and explication from the world to come, or world of the Resurrection. So our Saviour distinguishes. <hi>Luke.</hi> 20, 34.35. <hi>This world</hi> and <hi>that world, or this age</hi> and <hi>that age</hi> using the some word as here, meaning by that age the world of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> uses the same word to the same distinction <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. Where he says Christ is over all principalities not only in this world but also the world to come: Meaning by the age to come that called by our Saviour in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> that world or the world of the resurrection. So that the end of the world here is the end of this present evill world, as tis called <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. as tis opposed to the future good world at the Resurrection of the Just.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All days, pasas Hemeras:</hi> This age, untill the world to come, accounted from Christs coming, especially his Ascention, is usually called the times of the Gospel as opposed to the times of the law, and in that respect all things are said now to be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50669:108"/> new (though another degree of newness is reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the world to come) But this present world, or age, or Gospel-time is set forth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by one age, wherein there are many days as here; sometime by one day wherein is morning noon, and evening and many hours: In both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions is set forth the variety of changes that should happen in the present state of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All days until the Consummation:</hi> That is, all the days of peace, and all the days of trouble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution: all the days of purity and all the days of defection: all the days of declining and all the days of restoring: All the days of the Churches militancy, until all things are fulfill'd which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath designed to come to pass in the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the fulness of time in this age.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All days:</hi> These many days are sometime set forth by one day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.56. <hi>Abraham saw my day</hi> and was glad, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.2. In <hi>that day</hi> shall the Branch of the Lord be Beautifull and Glorious <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.10. In <hi>that day</hi> shall there be a root of <hi>Jess</hi> which shall stand for an ensigne to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to it shall the Gentiles seeke and <hi>Chap</hi> 12.1. In <hi>that day</hi> thou shalt say O Lord I will praise thee; and <hi>Ch.</hi> 26, 1. In <hi>that day</hi> shall this song be sung in the hand of <hi>Judah.</hi> And when this age is set forth by one day, some things relate to one part of the day, some to another, some things to the sunshine part, some to the Cloudy: Some to Morning, some to the Noon, some to the Evening, for this day hath no night: That place in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.5.6. describes the Complexion of this day: And may probably be the direct intention of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50669:109"/> place: How soever the words are a lively expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And it shall come to pass in that day</hi> (the Gospel day) <hi>the light shall not be clear nor dark: But it shall be one day known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This day we may say did arise gloriously in Christs Resurrection, the Apostles preaching and miracles, and the love of the first Churches: But in respect of the Jewish Ceremonies which were in effect standing, while the Temple stood, and some contending for them with Christ to have them both, some contending for them against Christ denying him to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi> And in regard of the hatred and persecution of the Jews against their Christian brethren, and the persecution of Heathens afterward and most of all in regard of that great eclipse of light within the Church, which <hi>Paul,</hi> that great Astronomer of the Church, foretold, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. and is described by St <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> by the woman in the wilderness, two witnesses clothed in sackcloth, and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin company of sealed ones: I say in regard of these things it may well be said that the light was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear nor dark, not day nor night. But in the evening of this day, the light shall recover to the Glory it had at first rising, and far greater the light shall shine to a perfect day without clouds, storms, eclipses.</p>
                     <p>Thus Christ promises to be with his Church all this day, or all these days, not as if there were a time when he should cease to be with them; but the Argument holds <hi>à fortiori:</hi> If he be with them
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50669:109"/> in the dark times of the day much more in the evening when all clears up: For after the stormy and cloudy time of this day is over, there will be a glorious evening, but no Sun set, as it is written <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.20. <hi>Thy Sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy Moon withdraw it self: for the Lord shall be thine Everlasting light, and the days of thy mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall be ended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ʋntil the finishing up of this age or end of the world:</hi> The full end of the world is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. When Christ hath delivered up the Kingdom to his father with a full Account of his Mediatorship. But the end of the world may be taken for the things to be done in the evening of the Gospel-day, which is the finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Gospel-Mistery in the dispensation of the fulness of times for the gathering or sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up all things in Christ. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. In which evening (which shall be very light) this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Christ shall be so far from ceasing, that it shall come to its greatest vigour, as may appear by the Glorious things spoken in the Scripture of the evening of the Gospel-day contemporary with it. As the Rejoycing of the Apostles and Prophets at <hi>Babylons</hi> down fall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.20: Christs appearing to the Jewes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30. <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.19.

                  <head>A Paraphrase of the whole.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O</hi> Ye my beloved Disciples, whom I have hitherto been instructing to, and preparing for the Kingdom of God: Know ye that I having done my Fathers will upon Earth in the frailty of humane nature. The time is come that my Father perform his promise to be for my Exaltation and Glory in this World, and the World to come; which he intends to bring on by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verl steps and degrees unto the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of all things promised, or foretold by the Prophets. I am already invested with ths possession of that universal power from the Father to be chief Monarch in Heaven and Earth. And do now enter upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual execution thereof, of which I shall give you three evident Demonstrations whilst I am here upon Eearth. First, In that I am risen, and have thereby overcome death. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In that I shall send forth a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry to reconcile the World to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue them out of Satans bonds. Thirdly, In that I shall ascend to my Father in your open view and triumph as a Conqueror over the powers of darkness. Other Demonstrations
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50669:111"/> of it shall appear when I am sate down at my Fathers right hand.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time: Behold I appoint and Ordain you an holy Gospel Ministry instead of the Priests and Levites, <hi>Isa. 66.21.</hi> and in you as Fathers and Heads of the Tribes of the Gospel-Church. Those whom I shall endue I shall endue with spiritual gifts (as I have done and shall do to you) answerable to what service I shall call them to, to be as your sons, and an holy seed under your tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition and education. And to you and them respectively in every age I say,</p>
                  <p>Go ye forth as ye shall see the providence of God to lead you: And let your first work be to convert Infidels to become my Disciples. To which end you shall preach to them this glad tidings of great Joy, that I the Saviour of the World, the Messiah promised am come into the World, was Dead, and am Alive: And have by my death removed the Wall of Separation twixt Jew and Gentile, and have obtained of my Father that the families of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations as well as those of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> shall be bl st in being the Church and people of God, and in a state of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, If they will testifie their belief in the Messiah, by being baptised they, and all theirs, and thereby engage to become new Creatures, and to that end become subject to my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:50669:112"/>
                  <p>Upon the hearing of which good means, many will rejoyce and readily receive the Word: many will neglect, despise, and mock at it. All those that readily receive it ye shall wash with pure water, men and women, old and young, into the name, profession, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the proper Characters of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And being so Baptised or washed, ye shall account them my Disciples in a state of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, set apart to eternal life, Saints by calling, an holy Nation, a peculiar people, that have put off the old Man, and put on the new, by profession and engagement: And as they shall be esteemed by you a saved peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so you shall promise to them in my Name, that persevering according to those begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with a good Conscience answering the first profession, they shall be saved from the wrath to come, and have a portion in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the just.</p>
                  <p>And to the end my Church thus begun, may be preserved and continued in the faith to the end of this world: And that nothing be wanting to promote the salvation of my Disciples. The Baptism thus begun you shall continue in the seed of the first Believers, keeping the faith from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby they being engaged to learn the truth from the beginning of their days may
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50669:112"/> be partakers of a godly education in the Church, which I shall provide for them for the feeding my Lambs and my Sheep: which is this.</p>
                  <p>The things which I have commanded you touching the Kingdom of God, you shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to faithful men both by word and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, who may be able to teach others also, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers I say, like faithful men in a continual succession, as a Seminary for my Ministry, among whom the truth may be carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, both in sacred writings and continual preachings. And my will is that out of such faithful men some be continually chosen that may attend the teaching the Baptised seed of the faithful, the Truths wherein they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have been instructed, and whereof they are firmly perswaded: And also exercise a fatherly oversight over them, for the helping their Faith, and Joy, and lead them forth as my Sheep to the green Pastures and Waters of comfort in greater and lesser Assemblies.</p>
                  <p>For as the need of my Church is more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or more particular, both for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Ministry, and for the exercise of it to the greatest benefit of my people: So I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly given diversity of offices &amp; employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Some as Apostles and first beginners of the work in any place, but especially such as were witnesses of my Resurrection. Some
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50669:113"/> Prophets to discover my mind in some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cases and times, to direct and encourage the work: Some Evangelists to carry on the work begun in Preaching, and Propagating the Gospel, taking care the deposited truth may be preserved, faithful men instructed to the Ministerial work, and overseen and kept to their work, and so to water the first Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in certain lesser circuits: some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Teachers, that may constantly attend in every particular Assembly.</p>
                  <p>In which order and care to observe my commands, Behold I will pour my spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the seed of the faithful, and my blessing upon their oftspring, and they shall grow up as Willows by the water courses: And the Spirit of Prophecy, or teaching the truth shall not depart out of the mouth of your seed, the Sons of the Prophets, nor their seeds seed, so long as a Ministry is needful for my Church.</p>
                  <p>And although I am absent in body until my second appearing, yet will I be present in my spirit to relieve, rejoyce and stablish my people though many days of tribulation and variety of changes attend them during their wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness-condition: yet I will never leave nor forsake the little Remnant that fear my Name. Amen.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:50669:113"/>
                  <p>But as for such as Receive not my Word of Mercy, and Salvation tendred by you, and refuse to become my Disciples, and will not enter into a Baptismal Covenant with me: or having entred do apostate from the Faith professed. You shall account them as out of my Church, not in a state of Salvation, whose sins are still retained: And if they so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and repent not, as Persons wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and condemned.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <argument>
                        <p>From this Commission thus understood, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conclusions of Christian Doctrine may be gathered and many Cases and Questions resolved: The meditation hereof may be commended to all that desire right Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, of his Love and Pity to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man, of the way of dispensing his Grace and Mercy to the sons of men, of his Justice in rejecting impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Of the Church, of the Ministry, of the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It shall suffice to give some few Instances only, and that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as searching after Truth than as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the Depth of it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. HEnce we may observe the truth and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of that distinction of a general and particular or personal Reconciliation: or in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50669:114"/> other terms a Reconciliation of our nature, and a Reconciliation of our persons: Both are spoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19.20. For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, when we were enemies, was done in our nature,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.4.</note> in the Person of Christ by his Death in a transaction twixt the Father and Christ: The Reconciliation of our persons, whereby we our selves are become friends and lovers of God is done in our persons by the power of Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection in us by a transaction twixt Christ and us in the Ministry of Reconciliation. This is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by this Commission; for here Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made atonement in our nature by his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and consecrating mans nature again to God as a fruit of this and his rising from the Dead, he sends forth a Ministry of Reconciliation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men personally to be reconciled to God. Hence the mediation of Christ consists chiefly in three things. First, His consecrating our nature to God. Secondly, in perswading mens persons to return to God. And thirdly, in presenting them so reconciled by his continual Intercession, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. <hi>Having made peace through the blood of his Cross, It pleased the Father by him to reconcile all things to himself.</hi> (there is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of our nature) <hi>And you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked work yet now hath he reconciled</hi> (there's the Reconciliation of our persons) <hi>to present you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unblameable in his sight</hi> (there's his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence we may have a very fair and safe notion about Gods Election, and Rejection: For we may conceive it in reference to our nature,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50669:114"/> and in reference to our persons. The nature of man, as it was in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> Jesus Christ, was chosen to have Communion with God; and as it was in the first <hi>Adam</hi> rejected. In reference to particular persons <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Rejection is to be conceived of us as the result of the Ministery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>To the one we are the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death, and unto death, to the other the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Life unto Life.</hi> Those that receive the Gospel are called elect, saved those that refuse, are called Condemned and Rejected. Now the Elect and Reject on account of Preaching the Gospel are under a double consideration of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and peculiar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a Common or more General Election of all that professedly recieve the Gospel, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, and are Baptised, or profess to Believe and become new Creatures. These all are chosen to the state of visible Churchood and to the hopes and possibilities of eternal life. This Election is all one with the outward calling and visible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption. As in the old Testament. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. <hi>The Jews were an elect nation and other nations reject.</hi> In the new also whole Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were elect, which is meant of their being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a people of God having a name to live in the Judgment of other Churches 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13. The Church that is in <hi>Babylon</hi> co-elect with you: <hi>And the Elect Lady and thine elect sister</hi> 2 <hi>John.</hi> and. 13. And when the Apostle says 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He knew their Election.</hi> This must needs be meant of that which is more Common, approving and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a people visibly adopted, and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> are put both for one
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50669:115"/> thing, and that which is common to all the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised; for this common <hi>Election</hi> gives only possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not a certainty of salvation, but may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to certainty, which is the reason why the Apostles do so much press Christians, whom they call elect, called, sanctified, yet not to presume but take heed they fall not away, and look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as under conditional promises.</p>
                     <p>There is a more peculiar Election of those who shall certainly be saved: This is an Election in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to hypocrites and meer formal profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, of them it is said 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. The foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God stands sure and hath this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his. This is set forth in Scripture by a <hi>Remnant according to the Election of grace,</hi> though the number of meer formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors be as the sand of the Sea <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.4.5. Here there is a superabundancy of grace and here is that abundant or rich entrance into the Everlasting Kingdom of Christ 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are in the porch, but these enter into the most Holy. This Election differs from calling <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14. Many are called but few chosen. This distinction is grounded on this Commission, He that Believes and is Baptised, in respect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form and profession, shall be saved, that is he shall be reputed in a saved state, among the saved ones or one of the visible Church: But he that believes and is baptised in the power of that profession shall be certainly saved or one of the peculiar Elect, which is true of all that die pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after a sincere submitting to Baptism: and those that fight the good fight to the end.</p>
                     <p>Hence assurance of Salvation, or of a peculiar
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50669:115"/> Election and Adoption, arises from the witness of the conscience touching the power of that we profess, which if it bear a true witness, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in the world makes one part of the Argument and witnesses with our conscience in the conclusion, thus,</p>
                     <p>He that unfeignedly believes in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and is washt from sin, in full purpose and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al indeavour shall be saved from the wrath to come.</p>
                     <p>This is the witness of the Spirit of Christ in the Word, but I do unfeignedly believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the witness of the conscience, or our Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I shall be saved. This conclusion is more than the voyce of our Spirit. It is the voyce of our spirit from concurrence with Gods Spirit speaking in his Word: And if the Minor propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition be true, the conclusion is as firm, as if the name of the person were written to the promise of Salvation: So assurance is gathered from, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                     <p>He that is sure shall not fall away, his Calling and Election is made sure and shall certainly be saved.</p>
                     <p>I am sure I shall not fall away, Therefore my Election is sure.</p>
                     <p>The Minor Proposition is proved thus.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>He that doth these things shall never fall away:</l>
                        <l>I do these things,</l>
                        <l>Therefore I shall never fall away.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Thus the Spirit of God witnesses with our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that we are the children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50669:116"/> But this whole assurance depends upon the truth of the witness of our spirit, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the <hi>Answer of a good Conscience,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</p>
                     <p>Whence it also follows, That the way to get assurance of salvation is to get and keep a good conscience: And according to the truth of the Testimony on my conscience, so our assurance is weak, or strong, something or nothing, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. If our conscience condemn us not then have we boldness before God.</p>
                     <p>But if the testimony of conscience be clear and good: The spirit of Christ doth not only witness together with our spirit, but doth superadd a seal, and an earnest, enabling the soul to make more conclusions of comfort peace and joy: If I am a Son, then an Heir, an Heir together with Christ: Then God loves me as Father, I may go to him with boldness. He is the God of peace to me: All things shall work together for the best. I may rejoyce in tribulation, nothing shall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate me from his love, yea my flesh shall rest in hope. Thus the Spirit of God in the Word, and the Spirit of Christ with the conscience is as a voice from Heaven, saying to the soul <hi>I am thy salvation.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 41.9, 10.</note>
                        <hi>Fear not, I am thy God, and the joy and inward peace is an earnest, being a first fruit of Glory and Eternal Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the promise (He that believes and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised shall be saved) is conditional; and so makes a professor of the Faith to be called Elect only in respect of the possibilities in the means of grace which he is under. And this conditionality is brought to a certainty, and absoluteness when the heart is stablish'd, and the conscience gives
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50669:116"/> a right answer as was noted before: So the threatning of rejection (He that Believeth not shall be damned) doth imply that there is such <hi>a Rejection as is not absolute,</hi> but only argues the present state of the person, who notwithstanding may afterward repent and be of the Church, or being a professor only in form, may become se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and sincere: And that there is <hi>a Rejection which is absolute and irrevocable;</hi> and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so rejected, sealed unto destruction: A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation frequently mentioned in the Scripture with the seal of it, hardness, blindness and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate sence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.11. <hi>To whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>In their filthiness is hardness, because I would have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee, Isa.</hi> 6.9, 19, 11. <hi>John</hi> 12.37. <hi>Therefore they could not believe because</hi> Isaias <hi>saith, he hath blinded their eyes,</hi> so <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23, 24. And this is a sentence of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for contempt of mercy in Gods way after visits of the grace of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Commission leads us to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the New Covenant and its difference from the Old, or abrogated Covenant of works. The New Covenant is apparently to be conceived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two transactions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The first between the Father and the Son.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The second between Christ and us.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The transaction (as it may be called for want of a better word)<note place="margin">Col. 2.2.</note> between the Father and Son is called by S. <hi>Paul</hi> the mistery of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50669:117"/> and of Christ. And by way of Explication called, the love of God the Father, the grace of the Son and Communion of the Spirit, in the fundamental transaction: though the Apostle may speak of it rather as in their Applications to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. The love and mercy of the Father is the fountain of all this divine transaction, (for he hath saved us not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.) His Love did set his manifold wisdom on work to make a law for mans Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and design a mediator. This Law was as we may partly conceive (for we know but in part in so great Misteries) That he that must restore man fallen from the Law of his creation, must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the nature of man to God Holy and without sin, must overcome Satan in all his Temptations, must bear the infirmities and calamities mans nature is subject to, by reason of sin, yea unto the bearing the curse, dying the death, and must over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, and communicate a new spirit of life, like to that that is in the Mediator to all those of the Children of the first <hi>Adam</hi> that are willing to be restored.</p>
                     <p>This law of the mediator Christ declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self willing to do in the body or humane nature <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5.7. When he is set forth as coming into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou fitted me. Then I said, lo I come to do thy will O God. And tis added <hi>Ps.</hi> 40.8. <hi>Thy law is in my Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <hi>That he perfectly fulfilled the Law of the Mediator</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:50669:117"/> by descending &amp; ascending; by descending he hath put an end to the rigorous exacting of the Law of Creation upon mans nature: And by his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he hath sent forth a new Life like unto his Life, to be communicated to any of the children of men that are willing to receive it, in and by the Ministery of Reconciliation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The second transaction in the new Covenant</hi> is with us, which may be cald the Gospel-covenant. Being the termes required of us that we may be saved by Christ: As Christ fulfilled this law, so we must fulfill our law, and then we shall be justified from all things through him, from which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be justified by the law of our creation in our selves, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39.<note place="margin">Act. 13.39.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>this Gospel-new-Law is in this Commission:</hi> He that Believes and is Baptised shall be saved: He that Believes not, shall be damned. He that obeys this law doth come under a new law of grace to be governed by, and is freed from the old law of creation so far as it was rigorous, but not as it was righteous. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. The righteousness of the law must be fulfilled in them that walk after the spirit.</p>
                     <p>Faith and Baptism are the Conditions of the new Covenant on our part, for the obtaining the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Christ's transaction with the Father for us.</p>
                     <p>A little to clear this.</p>
                     <p>Observe, 1. That faith since Christ ascending into Heaven hath respect to the doctrine of the Father, Son, and Spirit, as now fully revealed and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50669:118"/> is exprest in the creeds. We must believe the Love of the Father, the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Communion of the Holy Ghost, if we desire to partake of that Love, Grace and Communion, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. We have known and believed the Love God hath to us, And <hi>v.</hi> 8.9. In this was the Love of God manifested because he sent his only Begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins: so that <hi>We must Believe that Love God had to us, when we were enemies:</hi> It <hi>hath reference to the Reconciliation made in our nature before we are personally recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Observe secondly, That Baptism is put in here to the condition, as signifiying the same thing with repentance, a new Creature, being born again, putting off the old man, and putting on the new. <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.15. Jesus preacht, Repent and Believe the Gospel. <hi>John.</hi> 3.5. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. Whosoever is in Christ is a new creature <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Paul</hi> was sent to the Gentiles, to turn them from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive Remission of sins: No Remission of sin without a New Creature at least in the willingness and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <hi>Luke.</hi> 24.47. Repentance and Remission must be preacht together in Christs Name. Now Baptism as it is the Act of the Minister is nothing else but the Preaching Repentance and remission of sin, by a sign of water and significant actions; And as it is received by the Baptised it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a willingness to be made new Creatures, that so he may receive remission of sin.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:50669:118"/>4. As this commission shews upon what terms the new covenant was transacted twixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, namely the Sons performing the Law of the Mediator: And the terms on which it is transacted twixt Christ and us, namely Faith and repentance; or to be new Creatures, that we may partake Remission of sin and Adoption: So here is also shewed what is required of us that Faith and Repentance, or the new Creature may be fully wrought in us by the grace of God, and that is,
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>To receive the Grace offered,</hi> To which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am with you</hi> and</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>To improve the Grace received,</hi> To which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am with you</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To receive the Grace offered</hi> is signified in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to be Baptised, which is the lowest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention that can be imagined; for it implies only a yeilding himself to be washt, or to come under the Law of Grace whereby that may be done in us, which we cannot do of our selves, which is no more than to shew our selves men, rationall men and not brutes <hi>Isa.</hi> 46.8. <hi>Shew your selves men, O ye transgressours, Ezech.</hi> 34.31. <hi>Ye my flock are men:</hi> Yea so great is Gods condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that he is accounted to receive his grace, who doth not refuse or resist it: Who receives the Kingdom of Heaven as a little child receives it, who hath no Active will of his own, but others will for him: This is all that is as to the first degree of receiving.</p>
                     <p>The next is <hi>To improve the Grace received which is, in</hi> submitting to be taught, or <hi>a Teachableness.</hi>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:50669:119"/> Thus a man is bound to see with the light given him, to follow in the steps gone in before him. To walk in the path chalked out to him, to stir and move when he is moved: to incline the ear when we are spoken to. And as power and strength comes into us to be more abundantly active, and growing till we come to be stablish'd, strengthned, setled and fully perswaded that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall separate us from the Love of God in Christ Jesus. And thus if a Christian from the weakest beginnings does follow on to know the Lord, He shall find he is under the <hi>Law of Grace</hi> and the <hi>New Covenant</hi> founded in the perfect righteousness of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> through whom all the promise of Grace and Glory are Amen to those that yeild themselves to the Teachings of the Gospel. This will fully appear by these places.</p>
                     <p>Rom. 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing: The law of faith which the Apostle speaks of</hi> Rom. 2.27. <hi>requires that the merits of Christ for remission of sin be applied to us by faith and that faith come by hearing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Isa. 55.3. <hi>Incline your ear, and come to me, hear and your soul shall live. And I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you, the sure mercies of</hi> David: <hi>Here</hi> David <hi>is the Son of</hi> David: <hi>Jesus Christ of whose Grace and merit they are promised to partake, who Receive the Grace offered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>John 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the world: He that follows me</hi> (that is improves the light received from me) <hi>shall not walk in darkness but shall see the Light of Light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Rom. 6.13.14. <hi>Yield your selves to God, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50669:119"/> sin shall not have Dominion over you: Because ye are not under the Law, but under Grace, that is, not under the Law of works but the Law of Grace cald the Law of Faith</hi> Tim. 3.37.</p>
                     <p>Phil. 2.13. <hi>Workout your salvation, for 'tis God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure:</hi> That is God of his good pleasure hath so ordered the dispensation of his Grace and spiritual power, that he will work in, by, and with your work. His Grace will cooperate with you, and will not ordinarily operate without you: And that is your work when you act as Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men, then the Grace of God will help you to will that which is good and to perform it: But so, that when you have done it, the work is yours, the Grace is Gods and you must say I Believe, I repent and turn to God: <hi>Yet not I but the Grace of God with me as</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</p>
                     <p>So that this Conditionality (if we may so call it) of faith and repentance to the obtaining the benefit of what Christ hath done in our nature and of our work, to the obtaining of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, doth neither magnifie the power of man nor diminish the Grace of God, both being linck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, by a Law in the covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>This is the ordinary way God hath set to man for the dispensing of his Grace, to which Baptism gives an entrance, and Ministerial Teaching (or good education) the progress: <hi>Which by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God brings many to Salvation:</hi> And in this way man is bound to expect the Grace of God: And to expect it out of his ordinary way when he hath given a way for it, is to tempt him to work a miracle:</p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:50669:120"/>
                     <p>But yet God is not tied by this Law of Grace not to dispence his Grace, where man doth not answer in his Acting: The ordinary way of his Grace is: <hi>With the upright thou wilt shew thy self upright, and with the froward thou wilt shew thy self froward,</hi> but yet he can make the hypocrite upright, he can bring his sons home with an high hand. The covenant of Grace hath not only a law of Grace, but a superabundancy of Grace. Though he is tied affirmatively to make good his promise in the Law of Grace upon mans actings, yet he is not tied negatively not to shew mercy, where man acts not. The Covenant of grace hath grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grace: because <hi>God hath not only a Legal but a Prerogative will:</hi> and is not tied to dispence his grace only upon the exact answering of man in the Covenant. And therefore where the common and ordinary grace prevails not, but man resists the grace offered or neglects the Grace received, He can give <hi>a special Grace</hi> beyond the ordinary way to overcome all resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to quicken and make diligent: And the sending <hi>of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>e most special Grace,</hi> though it is not promised to man: yet we may conceive it to be promised in the Fathers transaction with Christ in order to make good his promise to him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.10, 11. <hi>When he should make his soul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for sin, he shall see his seed, and see of the travel of his soul and be satisfied: He should not die in vain.</hi> And that verified which our Lord says, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>None can come to me except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw him.</hi> The Father draws either by the ordinary way stablish'd in the Law of Grace: or by his special Prerogative. This special Grace
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50669:120"/> appeared in the Visitations of the first Churches of the Gospel. <hi>I am found of them that sought me not, Isa.</hi> 65. In the conversion of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> saving a remnant in time of general Apostacy; bringing home the prodigal Son. The other Son resembles one that is saved by the ordinary law of Grace, abiding in his fathers house and not displeasing him: So the nation of the Jews are not like to be saved but by a special Grace. In which respect the Apostle saith, <hi>the Lord is able to graft them in again, Rom.</hi> 11.23. And this appeared in <hi>Lot</hi> lingring to go out of <hi>Sodom:</hi> the Lord shewing a superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy on him, <hi>drew him out, Gen.</hi> 19.16.</p>
                     <p>Of this Prerogative will, its said, <hi>He shews mercy on whom he will, Rom.</hi> 9.18. For he settles the dispensation of his Covenant with some, and not with others. And he leaves some to the strict terms of the Law of Grace and not others, as it pleases him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Commission leads to the understanding several things about the <hi>Church of God.</hi> To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in some.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Hence is the true constitution of the Church, or that whereby a people become, and are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a Church of Christ, which is his School, a Temple of Divine worship, and a City of God. <hi>This is by the Ministry of Christ, and Baptism into Christ.</hi> Baptism supplies the visible <hi>matter,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry the visible <hi>Form,</hi> whereby the members are not only compact together as by several joints and bands, but do also act as a living body towards God, and one another.</p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:50669:121"/>
                     <p>And therefore the preserving the Church is the preserving the Ministry and Baptism in their integrity. The Apostacy of the Church is first of the Ministry in not preaching a true Gospel or not educating the baptised in all those things Christ hath commanded the Apostles, and giving exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in following the Apostles, who were followers of Christ, that so the true Religion might be an undoubted tradition: And this Apostacy of the Ministry is attended with an Apostacy from the power of Baptism, namely the observation of that that Christians are wash'd into: So that the way of recovery is to reduce our selves to our first love both in the Ministerial and Baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and from a meer name to live to the life. and power itself of that we profess. A prodigal Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is to be prest with his Baptismal engagement, and a prodigal Church with both, as a chief means to preserve them in and restore them to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive integrity, as the Scripture frequently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2, 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. &amp; 4.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. &amp; 11. <hi>ver.</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.5. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence is the distinction of the external forms of the Church, <hi>To be</hi> called <hi>Catholick and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> or <hi>more particular and individual.</hi> For the consideration of the Ministry gives this external form. As the Church was under the first Apostles so it was Catholick: Then when the Apostles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by consent, the Churches in the plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every Apostle were more peculiarly his ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rge, and so the Church or charge of every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle was general but not Catholick and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal: so <hi>Paul</hi> had the care of all the Churches of his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50669:121"/> plantation. Then when every Apostle divided his plantation into several charges under the inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of several Evangelists.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.28.</note> (As all the Churches in <hi>Creet</hi> under the inspection of <hi>Titus</hi>) This Church or charge of <hi>Titus</hi> was particular but not individual. But when every Bishop or Teacher (for at first they signified one thing) in <hi>Creet</hi> had a particular individual charge, that Church might be called individually particular. And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of these Churches greater or less were by reason of the Ministry (though they could not meet together personally) the Churches of Christ to whom he promises his presence: But the least and lowest consideration of a formed Church was an assembly of Baptised ones under the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inspection of a Teacher or Oveseer, sent by some power and authority from the Apostles, which power the Evangelists had; which Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was a School, for Doctrine, a Temple for worship, and a little City within a greater, as a Corporation within a Corporation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence are <hi>the true marks of the Church</hi> of God, namely, The Ministry of Christ preaching a true Gospel for converting Infidels and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Baptised the commands of Christ: And the use of the Sacraments, which engage to Christ. S. <hi>John</hi> calls these maaks the witnesses of Christ on earth: He saith there are three (stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) witnesses on earth (in the Church) The Spirit (that is the Ministerial Spirit of Prophesie) the Water, that is Baptism (or the Profession of the New Creature) and the Blood (a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and visible remembrance) of Christs death, the spiritual food of Christians, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.8. All
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50669:122"/> these witnesses agree in one thing to demonstrate that Jesus is the Christ, and to declare the true Church of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Hence is the unity of the Church. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry or Ministerial spirit is one, because it flows from one Root Jesus Christ himself, by commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Father. Baptism is one, because the Faith is one into which we are baptised, and that Faith and Baptism ministred by one spiritual mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. The Church is one body though it have many joynts of particular Churches: yet they are knit together by one Faith, and one Baptism unto our head by one ministerial Spirit. <hi>All the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed are by right of one Communion.</hi> So that all the Ministers of Christ by virtue of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial relation to Christ and the Church; and all the baptised by virtue of their Baptismal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to Christ and his Ministery, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are bound to keep the unity of Spirit and Doctrine of the Gospel in a bond of peace.</p>
                     <p>Hence they are guilty of breaking this Union, who either depart from the Communion of the true Church without cause given: or do give cause to the true Church to depart from them; which is on these two accounts: either when a Church degenerates from the truth of Doctrine or Worship, so far as that it becoms an heretical or Idolatrous church, or both (for they are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom severed): or when a Church retains the truth of Doctrine and Worship, but doth impose such things of necessity to be observed in order to her communion as cannot consist with a good conscience or Baptismal Covenant. In such a case they that depart are the true Church, because
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50669:122"/> they stick to their baptismal engagement. But the determination of the case to circumstance of time is not properly belonging to a private judgement, there being many things considerable to judge of the condition of a Church; What are to be counted sins of infirmity, what of obstinacy, and when patient waiting is to end; seeing it is the duty of particular Christians to continue in the Communion of the Church long <hi>in an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming way</hi> bearing witness against her corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not dividing from her Communion till there is no remedy.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This Commission leads to some Remarks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Baptism.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Hence the Baptism of the children of the Church, even in their Minority, appears lawful and expedient.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because there is a Gospel for every creature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because the word <hi>He</hi> is to be taken for a first believer in his political capacity for Himself and all His.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Because the first Churches were founded in believing families.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Because the believing Gentiles are as the Proselites adopted into <hi>Abrahams</hi> covenant.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Because Baptism respects the remission of the sins of Forefathers not only Original but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Because the Baptism of Children is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick testimony that the present church continues in the profession of the ancient faith, first given to the Saints.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Because Baptism is an engagement to a christian education: And education is not only
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50669:123"/> a means but a degree of regeneration.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Because Baptism of Children is an open confession of the Parents of their Faith in Christ, when they are of understanding, whereby the Church is not destitute of personal confessions of the Adult, which is an advantage to the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial work.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Because if children should not be engaged to the Faith before they are Adult; they would be tempted to take what Religion they please, which the Lord prevented among the Jews, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their proneness to offer their children and themselves to false gods and false worships.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Because the way of first planting the Church, is to teach that they might Baptise: But the way of continuing the Church is to teach the Baptised or to Baptise that they might be taught and so believe: for the power of Faith first brought in Form, but afterward Form introduces Power. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed that he might be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised; <hi>Isaac</hi> was circumcised that he might believe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Because the children of the Faithful are the children of the Church, as well as their natural parents, and the charge of the Ministry as the Lambs of Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.22. <hi>They shall bring thy sons of their Arms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence appears the reason that the Baptised are to have honorable Titles given them. As Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, called, Saints, washt, justified, sanctified, To be in Christ, Buried and risen with Christ, Dead to sin, alive to God: Not because they have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the power of all this; but because of the formal and Ministeriall work whereby the Baptised are
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50669:123"/> under a Repute both in their own and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Judgment, that they are in such a state of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and engagement and under means to be so, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. Reckon your selves dead to sin and alive to God, speaking of their Baptismal state) And such as have already attained the first step of Regeneration though very low, as the first step of the ladder which if improved will lead to the top: He that is Baptised is already entred into the Kingdom so far as to come under a Capacity or to be in the way of the promise of the spirit for a more Abundant enterance. The formal, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial work if done in sincerity is a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Regeneration. The power of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in a progress from this beginning, therefore the Apostle doth exhort to mortifie sin with power, because they are dead to sin in their formal and Ministerial state. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2.5. and doth in all his Epistles presse the Churches to attain the power of that they had already attained. To inform the formal and Ministerial work is indeed but low, and weak of it self and not sufficient: That which is but flesh, and water, and a female but it is not to be lookt on as a thing of nothing: Tis a divine beginning as an Introduction to an higher work: As the egge which being warm'd with the spirit will produce a living Creature <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6. The Church in respect of the Ministerial work may be called the mother and nurse of grace, but Christ himself is the everlasting father, from whom the spirit of life flows. In respect of the Churches work, the Baptised are said to be <hi>in Christ,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into him, reputed members of him: In respect of the work peculiar to Christ, <hi>Christ is said
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50669:124"/> to be in the Baptised,</hi> namely, when his word abides in them,<note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 15.4, 5, 7.</note> Know ye not saith <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>Christ is in you</hi> unless ye be reprobates: As if he should say for you to be approved in the faith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.5.</note> tis not enough that you be in Christ which the formal work implies by being washt, &amp; dedicated to him, and Justified from forefathers sins, and become members of his Church: But Christ must be in you in the power and truth of what you profess.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From the comparing this Commission with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6▪ it may probably be gathered if not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded. That where the miraculous besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of the gifts of the Holy Ghost on some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent believers at the first ended (which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven immediatly by Christ, or by the hands of the Apostles and them only as a sign and testimony of Christ Ascending into Heaven, his acceptance of the Gentiles to be his people, and their union with the Jews, and as a means for the speedy propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.8.) I say where this ended there the ordinary way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the spirit in the education of the Church began: Which was this. The Baptised were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the doctrine of God the Father, Son, and Spirit: And Repentance from dead works, the Resurrection and last Judgment, which were called doctrine of Baptisms; because they had a peculiar respect to the understanding the Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal engagement and profession. And upon the proficiency of the Baptise, Hands were laid upon them, that upon Examination were approved, in sign thereof, with prayer for a futher Increase and strength, which was as a solemn admittance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number, and Communion of the approved:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50669:124"/> And such as were not approved did remain as probationers: Those that were approved were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or those that were Baptised, Enlightened <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.32. This seems to be the sence of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. If those words the <hi>Doctrine of Baptisms and laying on of hands,</hi> be read within a parenthesis. And then they are as an Historical narration, what was the way of the Church after the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way ceased: And this agrees with two passages in this Commission 1. <hi>He that Believes not shall be damned,</hi> or judged and condemned, which words may not only refer to the final sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at the last day, but to the Ministerial or Church power of Recieving or rejecting, opening and shutting, binding and loosing (as was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the word <hi>saved</hi> was a direction to the Church how to esteem the Baptised, as well as a promise) So that these words may comprehend this threefold sence: He that believes not the Gospel and recieves it not when tis Preached to him, shall be condemned, at the last day for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing mercy offered: 2. He that believes not and declares it by refusing Baptism, shall be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned by the Church as no member of it. 3. He that Believes not, or approves not himself sound in the faith, though he be Baptised, yet shall be condemned as not fit for Communion of the Church. All which sences may be in the words. For we are bound to take the scriptures in the largest sence as <hi>David</hi> says,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.96.</note> Thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are exceeding large.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another passage <hi>is Teaching the Baptised to observe all things I command</hi> you among the things they were to observe, one was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50669:125"/> the memorial of Christs death: The Baptised therefore were to be taught and so approved in order to communicating in the Lords Supper. To all which may be added that the word <hi>Adokimos</hi> which is oft translated Reprobate as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. signifies not a finally rejected state with God, but only that Judgment the Church made of her officers, and members: as sound or unsound in the faith, and so fit for Communion with the Church whence the word <hi>Dokimos</hi> is frequently applied to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of men as well as of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.16. Acceptable to God and approved of men <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Apelles</hi> approved in Christ, that is, in the Christian doctrine 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. There must be heresies, that the approved may be manifest. Thus Imposition of hands was <hi>The rite of approbation,</hi> and they that were not approved and continued so, were said to have a form of Godliness, but denied the power, being Reprobate or never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Church concerning the faith 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5, 8. Of which the Apostle prophesies there would be a great number in the Church in the last times that would make the times very difficult to the <hi>Timothies</hi> of the Ministery, who labour to keep up the power of Godliness,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Hence Baptism is but once solemnly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered, but may be often renewed: For the whole course of a Christians life is nothing else but a continued Baptism or acting the Batispmal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>Imposition of hands was the first Recoginition of the Baptismal Covenant.</hi> And as the Jews were cald upon after some notable recedinations to circumcise themselves to the Lord, and take away
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50669:125"/> the foreskin of their heart. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. So it may be said oft to Christians, Baptise your selves to the Lord, least his fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it; because of the evil of your doings.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Touching the perfection of Baptism. Hence appears that Baptism is a perfect engagement and dedication to the faith and service of Christ, both as his scholar, and his foulder, without the help of any humane ceremony what soever: Yet Baptism is not said to be perfected and to attain its full end till the power of Regeneration is attained; and the inward Adoption sealed by the spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Hence appears that the understanding the Baptismal profession and engagement is the first lesson to be learned in the education of the Church: That Ministers should often Preach and presse Baptism on their hearers the honorable titles they are under, the great possibilities, the strong engagements, the certain performance of the grace and peace promised, the danger of receding and grieving the spirit, being certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. That this was the way of the Apostles when they spoke to Baptised Christians, arguing from the form to the power, hath been already in part noted, and may be further remarkt in <hi>Peters</hi> Epistles; when he presses them as new born babes 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. He has respect to their Baptismal birth: Then <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.21. he tells them Baptism saves us, and explains how: Then in the second Epistle the first fifteene verses. The things he chooses to put them in mind of before his martyrdom, are these things which are the Concernments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50669:126"/> For to compare v. 1. and 9. and there is the substance of the Baptismal form and profession, for <hi>Baptism is a profession of the Apostolical faith</hi> and <hi>to be purged from our old sins:</hi> Then there are the honorable titles given the Baptised. v. 10. <hi>Called and Elected,</hi> and v. 3. Called to glory and virtue. Then there is the making this sure by a diligent endeavour to abound in faith and vertue &amp;c. v. 5.6.7.8. Then there is the assurance of grace and peace to be multiplied, as the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Gods promise in the covenant in the way of our endeavour and diligence to keep the faith, and to escape the corruptions of the world, v. 2.3.4. and the certainty of a rich and abundant entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of Christ, which Baptism is a seal to them that endeavour after the power of it.</p>
                     <p>Nothing more effectual to perswade to continue in the faith, or for a prodigal to return do his duty. Nothing fitter for a Christian to have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to stablish him, or if he be stablisht to the present truth, to comfort him in tribulations or tentations when he may syllogize, or Reason with himself as the Apostle commands <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. Am I not dead to sin and alive to God? am I not Risen with Christ? am I not purged from my old sins? am I not under a law of grace? am I not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a promise of eternal life? shall such an one as I return as the dog to his vomit? shall such an one as I faint and be weary, and not hold up the buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, against the enemy and avenger, fighting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such assistances? <hi>David</hi> comforted himself with this argument, <hi>Ps.</hi> 116.16. O Lord I am thy servant and the son of thy handmaid; thou hast
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50669:126"/> broken my bonds. And <hi>Ps.</hi> 8.7.5. Of <hi>Zion</hi> it shall be said this and that man was born in her. and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> shew that a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath great hope of attaining to perfection from his answering the first beginnings. <hi>Phil▪</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. We are made partakers of Christ (his grace and glory) If we hold the beginning of our confidence (this is our Baptismal profession) stedfast unto the end.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. This commission affords several observables about the Ministery of Christ, and the duty of the Baptised in relation thereto. Which it may suffice to name.</p>
                     <p>Hence is the antiquity, dignity, unity, necessity or the Ministery: hence is the proper work of the Ministery; their power and authority; and the bounds Christ hath set to it,</p>
                     <p>Hence is the true succession of the Ministery (by the spirit) Hence is the education for it and what preparation to it. What abilities to teach: What Love to Christ: To all men in general. To the Lambs and sheep of Christ in particular what tenderness: Who is weak and I am not weak, who is offended and I burn not. What wisdom to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern: What courage to overcome difficulties. What contentedness with necessary provisions, what patience in afflictions.</p>
                     <p>Hence is the account they must render to Christ the chief shepherd &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And on the other side, Hence appears what love and high esteem the baptised ought to have of their teachers, what subjection in the Lord that they may give account with joy. And what willingness to communicate to them in all good things. &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:50669:127"/>
                     <p>The conclusion from the whole matter may be. That it is no presumption from hence to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</hi> That when the Ministery shall be wrought up to the life and power of this commission accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the simplicity and planeness of the Gospel of Christ:: And when the Baptised shall rightly understand their Baptism, and be educated and approved according to their Baptismal engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Then will our Lord Jesus manifest his presence more fully to his Church; his contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie and occasion of hiding his face removed: The difference of conformity and non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ceased: The complaints of setting up partition walls, and laying occasions of stumbling in one anothers way, and of divisions and separations ended: And God our God will bless us and all the ends of the earth, will fear him. To him be Glory and Dominion in all generations.</p>

                     <p>I miserable sinner condemned by the law of works do from time to time, continually flie to Christ as a refuge from divine wrath, with a self denying and Christ obeying spirit according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Mat. 11.28, 29. Psal. 66.18.</hi>

                     <p>I believe that hereupon Jesus Christ according to his promise, <hi>John 6.37.</hi> and the riches of his grace to poor sinners is propitious to me and makes intercession for me in the virtue of that sacrifice he once offered in my nature, and besprinkles me with his blood, <hi>Heb. 12.24. 1 Pet. 1.2.

                     </p>

                  <p>THe definitions, and distinctions of S. <hi>Paul</hi> are the more to be remark'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our blessed Saviour having delivered the Doctrine of the Gospel in a Parabolical way in his life time promised to shew his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles plainly of the Father after his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>John 16.25.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And S. <hi>Paul</hi> received the Doctrine by immediate revelation from Christ now, at the Fathers right hand, <hi>2 Cor. 12.4. 2 Cor. 4.6.12.4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of all the Apostles S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath most fully methodized the Doctrine of the Gospel; not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth (whether Rhetorical, Logical, or Metaphysical) but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, <hi>1 Cor. 2.13.</hi> For this divine sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath terms proper to it self, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by comparing spiritual things with spiritual. If therefore a Christian shall stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to understand Scripture Notions by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expressions he will find it wholesom, safe, and pleasant, yea sweeter than the honey and the honey-comb.</p>
